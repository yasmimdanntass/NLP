# BABY STEPS TO GET STARTED

### **1. Set Up Your Coding Environment**

If you're a beginner, such as your redactor herself, setting up your environment might seem overwhelming. Don’t worry — everything is only as impossible as you believe it is, and this one task is entirely doable (if you have a little bit of patience)! Follow these steps to get started:

**A. Choose the Right Python Version**

Some tools may not yet be compatible with the latest Python versions. To avoid compatibility issues, downgrade to an older version. I'd reccomend using `Python 3.9`, but most of these tools were also tested with `Python 3.7`. It's up to you.

**B. Install Essential Tools**

If you want to spare yourself some time, try to run the `pip install xxx` command with the following tools:

1. **NLTK**
2. **NumPy**
3. **SpaCy**
4. **Gensim**
5. **Matplotlib**
6. **Scikit-learn**
7. **Pandas**

If everything goes well with the installations, you're ready to our next step.

### **2. Practice using the examples of vectorization**
