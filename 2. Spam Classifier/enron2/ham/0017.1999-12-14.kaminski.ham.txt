Subject: a paper of mine
Vince,
I have written a paper, which supposedly is going to be published in the
February 2000 issue of eprm, probably after some editorial cuts (at least
This is what I am being told by them). I would appreciate your thoughts if
You would have time to read it.
Regards,
Martin
