Subject: petition for summer internship
Vince:
As we discussed earlier, I attached the copy of the petition for my summer
Internship with enron analyst and associate group.
I also have the hard copy of the letter, which I will deliver to you
Presonally.
I am looking forward to, finally, become an official enron employee. Thank
You very much for your valuable contributions to
My experience with the company.
