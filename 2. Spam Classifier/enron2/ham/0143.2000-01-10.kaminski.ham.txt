Subject: model development
Vince,
Here is our final draft for the model development report. I believe that we
Have incorporated all your comments from the last meeting. If you have any
Questions or would like to sit down and go over the report please feel free
To call myself or patty. If the report is ok or if there are some additional
Comments, I would appreciate if you would respond by wednesday january 12.
Thanks
Andy
