Oh dear!
I thought it was all straight. Ebl 931 was my room on the original floor
Plan,
But somehow they changed the numbers. We were all packed, everything
Was ready for the move and I just happened to come to the 19 th floor the
Day of the move and noticed that they had renumbered all of the rooms!
The move team hurredly put stickers (with the old numbers) on the doors
Of each room.
I am now in eb 1961. Vince kaminskI is in 1962. If you need the names
For all of the other rooms, let me know.
Sorry!

Shirley,
I guess my floor plans are misnumbered.
In what room number are you sitting? The relocation request had eb 1931.

Shirley,
Although the rent for your locations on the 19 th floor has been updated, i' ve
Just received a relocation update for some folks moving from the 45 th floor
To the 19 th floor tonight. The odd thing is that among many other locations,
The following locations were included (which you' ve already requested be
Assigned to 0011/100038):
Eb 1930
Eb 1931
Eb 1932
Eb 1933
Eb 1934
Eb 1935
Eb 1936
Please let me know if they should stay assigned to your group or should they
Be assigned to this other group' s r/c.
Thank you.
