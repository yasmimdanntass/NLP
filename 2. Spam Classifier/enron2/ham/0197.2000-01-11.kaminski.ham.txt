Subject: acceptance of offer
Sir,
I have decided to accept your offer of employment here at enron. Please let
Me know how I can help with the" hiring - on" process. May I ask what is the
Effective hire date? That information will help me when I switch over from
Prostaff.
Thank you for this wonderful opportunity!
Sincerely,
Sam smith
