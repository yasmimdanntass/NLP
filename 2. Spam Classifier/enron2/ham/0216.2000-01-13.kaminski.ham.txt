Subject: congratulations
Vince: congratulations on your promotion. I know it is well deserved! I
Have not seen you in a while since I am not riding the woodlands bus much
These days. I am expecting a baby for the end of february 2000 and it is
Much easier to drive than to ride the bus!
Take care and congratulations again,
Darlene norris
