Subject: access to research project tracking database
Kevin kindall brought to my attention that a number of new members in the
Group may need to get access to the research projects tracking database in
Lotus notes. Access can be requested through use of the secutity resource
Request form accessed from lotus notes. Just submit the form requesting
That you be added as a user of the research group' s research projects
Tracking database.
Thanks,
