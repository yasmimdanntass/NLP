Does not have a computer in her office on the 19 th floor.

Subject: new pc
HI shirley,
I would like to request for a new pc. My current pc is quite old with not
Enough memory. Twice
I ran out of memory and had to have it people coming to clean it for me.
Their suggestion is
To either get a new hard drive or a new pc. Given that dell has pentiumc iii
Processor at 800 mhz
On market, I would like to request a pc with process at 500 mhz or higher
Level.
Thank you very much.
Best,
Alex
