Subject: work at enron
Hi, vince
I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for a
Position with your group. I find the work described very interesting and
The work environment very appealing.
I think the retail area would be a good match with my skills and
Interests, and I could make a contribution very quickly. I believe that
The power and options valuation areas would make a good fit as well, if
That matches your needs.
Thanks again,
Bob lee
