Subject: computers from research group
Good morning all:
This past weekend you moved two computers from ebl 972 b and 1972 g
And were supposed to install them in ebl 941 and eb 1952. What
Happened? There is no computer in eb 1941 and only the monitor in
Eb 1952. We need this equipment back. Please install as soon as
Possible.
Thanks and have a great day!
Shirley
