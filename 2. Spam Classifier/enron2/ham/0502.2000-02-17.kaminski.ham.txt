Subject: move to the research area
HI shalesh:
The move team has informed me that they will not be able to move your
Telephone until wednesday, the 23 rd. I have asked them to bring you
Boxes by friday, but I have not heard back from them. Your computer
Is here, but without a telehone, you may not want to move down here
Until the 23 rd.
Just to let you know.
Have a great day!
Shirley
