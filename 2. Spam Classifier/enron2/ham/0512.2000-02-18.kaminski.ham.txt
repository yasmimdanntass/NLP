Subject: resumes
Charlene,
I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer
Interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.
In the case of paulo rocha we don' t have a formal
Resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.
Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.
Vince
