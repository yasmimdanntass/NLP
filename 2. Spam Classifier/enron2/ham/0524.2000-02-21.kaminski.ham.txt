HI amy
A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a phd whose
Background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
Looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
Developing skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
Well. The issue is that he is based in chicago and I wondered if there
Would be any interest from your headquarters there.
Please find attached his details.
Speak to you soon.
Regards
Simon
