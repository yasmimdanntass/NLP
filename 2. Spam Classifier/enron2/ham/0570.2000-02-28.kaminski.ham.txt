FyI - us inflation - linked bond
I can not replicate the nominal yield and inflation adjected cash flow
Calculation from bloomberg. So I called the bond analytics group.
I got to the point that they admit that they have made mistakes in their
Calculation, and promised to fix it.
Once I got the issues settled, there will be a better us inflation model.
