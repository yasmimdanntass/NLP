Subject: off duty days
Good morning all:
Most of you do this, but just in case, please advise me of any off duty
Days, i. E. Vacation, sick, personal, jury duty, etc. As soon as possible,
Either before or as soon as you take them.
Also, I am making new wallet info cards and if you have not sent me
Your home telephone number, or if you have a new one, please let
Me know as soon as possible.
Thanks and have a great day!
Shirley
