Stinson,
Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills.
We might have maxed out on the
Number of summer interns through
The a/a program. We would have to
Hire him directly.

HI ravi:
I had sent an email about a week back with my resume for the summer
Internship. I think the address I sent it to was not correct, so I am
Resending it. I will also tell the others in the group to send there resumes
To you. Thanks.
Regards,
Shikhar
