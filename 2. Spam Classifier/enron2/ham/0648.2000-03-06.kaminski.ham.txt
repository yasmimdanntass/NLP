Subject: thanks for the interview
Dear vince,
Thanks for the interview with enron. I appreciated your time and the
Conversation that we had together. I really enjoyed my time at enron and
Believe that it is the type of company that I would like to work for. More
Specifically I enjoyed meeting the people in the research group and feel
That I could make a contribution and fit in well. I look forward to
Hearing from you or an enron representative.
Sincerely,
Lance
