Dear wincenty kaminski,
Today' s focus: bug alert: welcome
By jason meserve
Welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter!
Given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
Attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
Newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is
Clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
Should be.
With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
Center, it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
And running as well as secure. No chief information officer or network
Manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
Been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that
Tend to stick in a potential customer , s mind more than an expensive
Super bowl ad.
It , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind
Latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
Application. But we , re here to help.
Once a week we , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
Major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We , ll
Also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security -
Conscious it manager.
Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to
Jmeserve@ nww. Com.
Now on with the latest patches and alerts:
