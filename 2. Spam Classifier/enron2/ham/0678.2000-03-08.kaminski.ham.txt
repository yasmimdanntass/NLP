Subject: ebs research office space on 45 th or 43 rd floor
HI stinson, as per my discussion, here is e - mail to let vince know about the
Subject.
We have requested the following office spaces for network planning (jim
Irvine) - - optimization work, etc. And other ebs support personnel.
For network planning and traffic engineering:
- 1 director level space (to be used by jim and other ebs research people
As needed when jim is not there) and four other cube space (chonowee, martin
Lin, and two students.
For other ebs activities:
- 3 or 4 summer interns and analysts level space for other ebs people (roman
And other students).
This is what kristy is going to request and get it into the office space
Request loop. We should be able to get into most of the space that I have
Requested.
