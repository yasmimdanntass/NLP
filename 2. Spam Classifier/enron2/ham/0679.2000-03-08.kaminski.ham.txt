Maureen,
I apologize that your phone was disconnected in error. At this time your
Phone is working and your voice mail box needs to be set up. I would like to
Add however, I do not appreciate your disrespect and unreasonable demands
Placed on my employees. They were not the cause of this problem and can only
Relay your information to the appropriate group.
Enron has values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence. I
Would appreciate you taking the time to review them.

Please reinstate maureen' s extension immediately, if possible. It was
Disconnected this past weekend when we had it taken off of the phone at eb
3073 f. Her extension was on two phones at two different locations and should
Not have been disconnected at eb 1939. Her extension no. Is 30396. Sorry
For the confusion. Please let me know timing asap.
Thank you.
