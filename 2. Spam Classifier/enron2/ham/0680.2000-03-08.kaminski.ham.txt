Subject: copier on 32 nd floor
Hello iain,
Well time is drawing near for another move
For us.
The problem is we do not have a heavy duty
Copier for the floor.
We do need a copier.
Please inform me as how we can work through
This, maybe we can split the cost with others on the floor.
The move is schedule sometime at the end of the month.
I will keep you informed........
Thanks
