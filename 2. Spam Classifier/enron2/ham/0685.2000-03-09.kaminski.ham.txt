Dear vince/grant,
It was good to meet and talk with you both this morning - very interesting.
Here are the details of the course (actually there are two seperate
Courses, one on var) that I promised you.
I hope to see you both again later in the month.
Best regards.
Chris.
Course 1: energy derivatives: pricing and risk management
-
Course leaders: dr les clewlow and dr chris strickland
Houston: 29 - 30 march 2000
London: 3 - 4 april 2000
Fee: stg 1950/usd 2950
This is an intermediate course aimed at the energy professional who is
Familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical
Foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and
Risk management of energy derivatives.
This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic
Option pricing theory (the black - scholes formula, monte carlo simulation,
And the use of binomial trees for option pricing).
The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and
Successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and excel based computer
Workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited
To a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.
The excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as
Electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and
Risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a
Diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code
For pricing and simulation.
Registration fee includes: pre - course reading, course materials, copies of
Relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to
Computer workshops, lunch and refreshments. Additionally, each attendee
Will receive a free copy of clewlow and strickland' s forthcoming book
" energy derivatives: pricing and risk management" which includes
Valuable contributions from enron' s vince kaminskI and grant masson.
Upon registration, participants will be sent a pack containing relevant
Pre - course reading.

Dr. Les clewlow and dr chris strickland hold associate research positions
At both the school of finance and economics, university of technology,
Sydney and the financial options research centre, university of warwick,
Uk. Together they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial
And energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic
And trade journals. They are the authors of the book" implementing
Derivatives models" (wiley, 1998) and editors of" exotic options: the state
Of the art" (itp, 1998). Their forthcoming book," energy derivatives:
Pricing and risk management," is due to be published during the second
Quarter 2000. Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy
Derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools
For electricity options and other energy derivatives.
