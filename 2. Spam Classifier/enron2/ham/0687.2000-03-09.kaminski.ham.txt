Ravi,
It' s fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it' s equal to the
Cost of the alternative).

Fyi, I may have to stay over weekend. Vince, if that is the case, I may have
To bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc. I may ask
John to cover some of that cost as (I think) he is done with other people.
I' ve seen other guys family members showup. This cost would equal what ebs
Would have spend to send me home and bring me back again, etc.
Ravi.
