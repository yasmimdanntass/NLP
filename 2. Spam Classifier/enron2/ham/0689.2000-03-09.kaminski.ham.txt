Dear rex,
I believe there might be a few additions to this core group. I have spoken
With sherron watkins and she is handling the storage side of the deal from
Product development perspective (john bloomer' s team) and so she would need
To be a part of this core group. I am trying to determine who else is
Involved with storage within ebs so that we don' t replicate our efforts. I
Am hoping that after tomorrow' s meeting we will have a better picture of how
To go forward on this project. Please let me know if you need any further
Information regarding this project. Thank you very much for your interest
And I look forward to meeting you in the near future.
Sincerely,
Shalesh ganjoo

Shalesh, mark - -
Thanks for pulling this together. Is the core team mark, mary, kara, mike,
Virawan, and shalesh? I know that there is a lot of interest in this topic,
But
You folks will need to carefully control the noise level from all the input.
Let me know how I can help. Best regards.

Ladies and gentlemen,
Stinson just pointed out that I forgot to mention that the meeting is
Scheduled
For tomorrow (10 th of march 2000) between 2: 30 pm and 4: 30 pm. It may seem
Like
A very short notice; however, we (mark, mary, kara, mike, virawan and myself)
Had initially set this time and date last week. In the future I will make
Sure
That everyone is notified early. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have
Caused. Thank you.
