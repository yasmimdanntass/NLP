Subject: re: storage meeting
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stinson just pointed out that I forgot to mention that the meeting is
Scheduled for tomorrow (10 th of march 2000) between 2: 30 pm and 4: 30 pm. It
May seem like a very short notice; however, we (mark, mary, kara, mike,
Virawan and myself) had initially set this time and date last week. In the
Future I will make sure that everyone is notified early. Sorry for any
Inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you.
