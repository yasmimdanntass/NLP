Would you be willing to pay for this? Since he is a ph. D. And specifically
For your group, this should be your call. Let me know if your business unit
Agree to pick up this additional cost.

Ms. Roberts, thanks for the quick reply! I received the offer on thursday,
And i
Am very excited about joining enron this summer. My research group is
Establishing a long term collaboration with dr. KaminskI and dr. Gibner, and i
Hope to help foster this relationship this summer.
I would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status of
International student. As an international student, I am required to enroll
Part
Time at stanford university during the summer quarter in order to be
Considered
Eligible for a summer internship (" optional practical training"). The cost of
The part - time tuition will be approx. $2300 for this academic year. The past
Summer, my employer (at it would be of
Course
Very much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition of
Ph. D. Students). Yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that my
Acceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this
Issue,
And that I intend to be at enron this summer.
All the best,
Giuseppe
