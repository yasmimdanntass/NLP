Subject: daily rates - jackups
John:
Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed
Jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and
Semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a
Simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.
The results show a good r - square between the general index and individual
Jackup categories - on the range of 0. 7 - 0. 8. Only one category displayed a
Poor r - square - about 0. 3. For semis of 4 tht and 5 th generation, however, we
Noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - r - squares about 0. 2 - 0. 3.
You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (ax 2 on analysis).
Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,
12 month swaps on gas/crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.
We will forward the results as soon as we finish.
Please call me or claudio if you have questions.
