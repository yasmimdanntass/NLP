Subject: new businesses in london: weather & insurance
HI vince,
Talking to the staff in london, I heard that lynda clemmons and a few of the
Key weather desk members left to start their own business. I am hearing that
London may gain more independence from houston and gain its own book and,
Interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/insurance
Derivatives market. I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity
To formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing
From joe to myself plus start talking to vasant about the new markets on the
Insurance side. I will call you later to discuss this with you.
Regards,
Anjam
