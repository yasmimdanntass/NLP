Subject: summer position
Dear celeste and stinson,
I am writing to refuse enron' s offer for a summer position. After several
Conversations with my advisor at stanford, we have decided that I should
Remain at stanford to work on my dissertation.
Thank you again for taking the time to show me around enron.
Sincerely,
Amy ward
