Dear dr. Lu:
Thank - you for meeting with me to discuss opportunities in your derivative
Pricing group. I very much enjoyed talking with you. The projects you are
Working on are quite interesting to me. It appears to me the resources and
Culture at enron are excellent for accomplishing quality value - adding work.
I would very much like to be a part of your group. Thank - you once again for
Meeting with me. And it goes without saying - lunch was great!
Sincerely,
Rodney greene
