Dear all,
Attached is the spreadsheet" benzenecurves. Xls" (also available in
S:\research\globalproducts) that will hopefully allow you to derive a
Mid - curve for benzene based upon our existing naphtha curve produced by
Tracy. The previous hedge ratio analysis is still part of the new
Spreadsheet.
For clarity a graph of the curve based on 1996 through 2000 data is depicted
Below:
I can also provide confidence bands on the regression model, if this can
Assist in deciding the bid - offer spread for the forward curve, but this is
Slightly more involved - let me know you' d like this.
Regards,
Anjam
