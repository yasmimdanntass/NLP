Subject: enron media/advertising
Simon,
Please forward a copy of my ken rice presentation to vince kaminski. Send
Him the version with the white background.
Vince:
Thanks again for meeting with me today and I am pleased that you are
Interested in discussing this opportunity in more detail.
Feel free to contact me should you have any questions. As discussed, the
Enron media/advertising idea is being developed under ebs, but should
Develop into its own business unit.
Enron media/advertising:
- advertising risk book
- physical trades, supported by excess inventory from cable networks, radio,
Network tv, etc.
- media buying service
- alliances with advertising agencies to sell enron' s" eyeballs" from our
Customer/server - isp relationships i. E., us west
- agencies could endorse ebs to their customers (ford gm, procter & gamble,
Etc.) and become an extended enterprise for ebs and our ein applications
- enron' s capital, to fund content development for the networks and
Hollywood, which in turn would provide content for our pipes with licensing
And syndication rights.
- an enron on line b to b opportunity (you may want to review the following
Sites: doubleclick. Com, agency. Com, adauction. Com)
Mark and kal:
Vince and I are meeting on tuesday, march 28 th@ 3: 00 pm to further discuss
The development of the enron media/advertising concept. Can you join us to
Provide a customer and agency perspective?
Regards,
Michael p. Horning
