Dear vince,
Dzien dobry. Many thanks for agreeing to take the remainder of the var
Seminar - it is a great help. I asked raymond yeow of enron australia if he
Would chair day one but he said that you would be a bigger draw and perhaps
Better placed. To this end, I am hoping that you would consider chairing day
One' s plenary session and trading stream. You can blame raymond for
Recommending you! I appreciate that this is asking even more of you than
You originally signed up for but you seem to be famous in this small market
And it would be great if you could do it.
I apologise for imposing once again but look forward to hearing back from
You when you get a chance. As ever, let me know if you have any questions.
Best regards,
Joel
