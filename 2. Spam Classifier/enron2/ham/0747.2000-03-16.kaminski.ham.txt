Hello vince,
How are you this week?
My week is pretty relaxing - I am taking the training for the very last
Product of my company, called voicenet, and I will achieve the highest state
Of initiation with destia (viatel) products, ha...
Unfortunatelly I have not been promoted for business vip representative (the
Position associated with t - 1) as I do not have any experience with it.
I am blaming myself because I cannot discipline myself to study consequently
Every day for gmat.
All the best to you and see you on saturday.
Patrycja
