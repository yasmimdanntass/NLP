Maureen,
The energy ceo roundtable hosted by gov. Johanns has been scheduled for
April 20 th 10 a. M. - 2 p. M. Does this date work for you? As we have
Discussed, your presentation would provide the governor and his guests with a
National/global perspective on pricing trends for natural gas, electricity
And oil and their impact on agricultural production costs. We may also
Include a hedging presentation, but have not committed to do so yet.
Your presentation would be scheduled at the start of the meeting, w/an
Anticipated length of twenty minutes. A university of ne ag economist will
Provide a state perspective for the group. Following the conclusion of both
Presentations time would be allotted for questions. We expect approximately
20 people to attend the roundtable.
