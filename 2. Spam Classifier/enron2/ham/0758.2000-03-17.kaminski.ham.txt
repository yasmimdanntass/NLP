Sorry it took so long to get back to you. There are a couple of things to
Keep in mind:
- enron it supports enron equipment.
- all equipment must be purchased through" enron it purchasing"
Our current high end desktop is a 800 mhz pentium iiI machine with 128 m of
Ram. You can bump up the ram to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the lghz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our
Standard.
What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.
The" image" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when
It is deployed. If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image
For, we can' t support it for a multitude of reasons.
Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.
If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.
Thanks

I have developed a model for enron that requires ultra - high - end pc
Performance (it does many calculations in excel), and my boss has authorized
Me to buy whatever pc I need. I' m looking at the compaq 850, but richard (our
Floor rep) says no pc' s over the 600 series will be supported by it. I need
To resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of
Machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it.
Sincerely,
