Subject: re: eott options
Tracy,
Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both black - scholes and
American option valuation models. These are the generally accepted methods
For valuation of options on equity. The" european" option prices assume
That the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the
" american" style options can be exercised at any time during their life.
I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market
Value of $13. 00 and that the options are struck at this level. The
Volatility input is the other main assumption. Eott has been trading
Recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking
Further back, the range is much wider.
To run the model, you must be linked with the options library. I am not
Sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with zimin lu
(x 36388) for help with loading the option library add - in module. On the ena
Lan it is located under o:\research\exotica\xll\exotica. Xll. This is
Loaded in excel using the tools/add - ins and browse to reach the add - in
Location.

P. S. I will mail you a hard - copy of a plot showing recent eott volatility
As well. If you would like us to help you in running specific examples,
Please let me, vince, or zimin know.
