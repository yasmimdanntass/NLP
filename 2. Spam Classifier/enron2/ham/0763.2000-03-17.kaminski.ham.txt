David,
I am leaving for vacation this weekend and I haven' t received the copy of
Your presentation yet.
The window during which I could make changes to my presentation is closing
Very fast. Let' s
Do the following: I shall keep my presentation as is (this means that I shall
Use the copy of my
Presentation I sent to dawn scovill and you this week). If there is an
Overlap between our presentations, so be it.
Dawn, please use the copy of my presentation I sent you earlier this week.
Vince

Dawn,
I met david sobotka from koch this morning and we talked about coordinating
Our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that.
The portions of my presentation
Will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more
Pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
Plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution +
Plus examples of some
Standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
Specific deals executed by our companies.
I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what
The deadline is.
Vince
