Subject: argentina power & gas market modelling
I would like to initiate a team to address the continued improvement of the
Argentine power & gas market models. I spoke with vince this morning and we
Reviewed that history of work to date and what we will need to do from here.
A summary is as follows:
Team:
Ba members: julian poole lead
Mario benitez associate
Ba associates: diego hollweck associate
Bernardo andrews associate
Santiago porta associate
Houston members: to be named.
Time schedule: as soon as possible. Completed before june 1, 2000 winter in
Argentina.
Scope of work:
Power model: advance the current model from basic load forecasting to
Incorporate weather, hydrology, improved short term and long term forecasting.
Natural gas model: build a supply and demand load forecasting model
Incorporating weather, thermal demand, pipeline flow rates, well head
Supply, improved short term and long term forecasting.
Phase I - data request
Power
Historic weather: temperature - daily, hourly, min, max, average
Humidity
Precipitation
Cloud cover
Regionally
Forward weather: temperature - daily, hourly, min, max, average
Humidity
Precipitation
Cloud cover
Regionally
Historic hydrology: reservoir levels
Reservoir capacity
Current hydrology: reservoir levels
Remote monitoring: aireal, pressure device, laser
Snow pack: density volume and mass
Power supply: current and future capacity
Transmission
Capacity: current and future capacity
Natural gas data list to be developed
Phase iI - power model development
Phase iiI - natural gas model development
We will take advantage of the fact that the associates are in houston for the
Next two weeks. Vince is out next week but we can start with a process
Discussion with grant masson next week. Julian please get a meeting scheduled
As soon as possible. We should immediately start collecting data.
Thanks
