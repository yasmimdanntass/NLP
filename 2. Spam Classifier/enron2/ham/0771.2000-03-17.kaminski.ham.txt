Subject: thomas knudsen
HI vince
I met with thomas this morning (I gave you his cv before, though I don' t know
If you had time to read it). He' s extremely interested in moving to enron,
And accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research,
Although far broader than his investment banking quant experience. He
Remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but
Wants to look at new markets and products. I think we should seriously
Consider hiring him. He is (understandably) reluctant to move to houston,
But there' s no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives
Pricing (and thinking) here in london.
Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple
Of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him? I' m meeting with him again
On tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by lane at king' s
College. I' ve attached his cv for your reference.
All the best,
Steve
