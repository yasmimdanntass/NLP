Dear riskbrief subscribers

Moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
Including tradeweather. Com, weather - risk. Com and. Com.
Along with the weather trading site from liffe (I - wex. Com),
Launched in january, and the introduction last september of
Weather futures on the chicago mercantile exchange (cme), there is
Something of a rush on.
To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
An introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
Exclusive book offer.
