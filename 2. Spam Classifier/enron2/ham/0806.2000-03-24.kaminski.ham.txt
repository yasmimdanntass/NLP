Dear everyone,
We understand the as members of enron research group, all of us are working
On very interesting projects, some of which are ground - breaking, and we all
Keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology. We also find
Out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,
It becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
Abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let
Alone in the industry. It is also our personal experience that many a
Project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
This group.
As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
Lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on friday, for about 50 minutes.
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
Technology and development, as well as with each other , s work, so that we do
Not have to reinvent the wheels.
We envision the following: in this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will
Take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from
Theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing,
Process modelling, insurance issue, or monte carlo simulation, or anything
One finds fascinating. The presentation material could be papers you have
Been reading recently, projects you are working on, some problem that
Bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You choose your own
Presentation style. It could be
Everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask, hand waving
Style, or it can involve nitty - gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style
That suits you and the topic. Or it can simply be a dry - run for your
Presentation at the next risk conference. Zimin and alex will take upon the
Responsibility of organizing the seminar.
We hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks. For that
Purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either zimin or
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
Provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to
Hear your presentation.
We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give a
Talk or just sit in.
