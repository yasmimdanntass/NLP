Subject: re: meeting today and trip to houston
Omar, thanks for the presentation and the e - mail. As I tried to emphasize on
The phone call, there will be short - term and long - term efforts to utilize
Opnet. Often the short - term needs rules at ebs. We will sort out what they
During our discussion in houston. I am confirming the meeting in houston
6 - 8 th.
I shall ask shirely crenshaw to arrange for a conference room on the 19 th
Floor. The meeting will be held all day from april 6 th, 7 th and half day 8 th.
The 8 th is a saturday and the meeting will be held to wrap things up if
Needed.

Background info. For enron research people. Opnet is a simulation tool that
Many in the industry use to do capacity planning to ip based applications and
Services on a network. Detail adenda will follow.
I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this
Morning to discuss the performance engineering program at ebs. I think
You' ll find that the value to enron from the overall approach is quite
High. I have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers
That need to be addressed as we move forward. As I work with you, I think
We' ll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when.
As soon as you confirm your schedule for april 6 - 8, i' ll book my travel to
Get to houston. I' ve already put in a call to opnet technologies to have
Them get a resource out to houston on one of those days for a demonstration
And q & a about the opnet toolset.
I' ll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in houston and get
It out to you next week.
