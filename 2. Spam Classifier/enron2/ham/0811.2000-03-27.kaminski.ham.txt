Subject: re: forecast rates!
HI vince,
Thank you for sending me the email from don reid regarding the turkey fx and
CpI curve. I received the same email last week and the request has been
Taken care of. In fact, he had a very short time line for the request and
Had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid. If the deal goes
Through rac, i' m sure we' ll get another request for the curve, but for now,
Don said that he doesn' t need a forecast from us.
Regards,
Farouk z. Lalji
