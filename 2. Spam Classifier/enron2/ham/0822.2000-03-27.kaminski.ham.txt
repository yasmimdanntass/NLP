Vince,
Linda vargo asked me because I am the administrator of employee referral
Program to contact you on whether or not lI xiao is eligible for a bonus on
His referral of alex huang. I have informed linda that the decision up to
You. If you feel that alex huang was hired as a result of lI bringing him to
The attention of enron then the bonus is due. Linda and yourself have
Communicated via e - mail on this issue in early february and it appears from
That correspondence that lI did encourage alex to e - mail his resume to you.
Please advise as to whether or not you want to award the bonus.
Thank you
