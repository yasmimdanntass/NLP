I would like to invite you to an off - site meeting of john griebling' s
Organization
And the research group.
Date: april 27 - april 29
Location: breckenridge, colorado
As you know, john griebling is managing the network design and construction
Project
Currently under way in ebs. The research group is actively involved in this
Effort
Which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic
Optimization and
Stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting internet traffic flows).
The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish
Transfer
Of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project
In the future.
We are inviting ken rice and kevin hannon to this meeting. We would
Appreciate if you could
Speak, together with kevin and ken, on strategic directions of ebs. It is
Important for a group
Of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to
Understand the big picture.
I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.
