Subject: michael sergeev' s rotation
HI mike, as per our discussion I have managed to find a place for michael in
Ebs' d. C. Office. It is likely that he will work for me on the ebs side but
Will live in d. C. I will finalize that later. Vince had mentioned that it
Is okay with him as long as it is okay with you. So please double check with
Vince on this.
I suggest the following transition:
Start date in d. C. May 1, 2000
From now till the start date, michael will slowly transition into my group
But make sure that your activities are transitioned into someone else. But i
Would like to propose the may 1, 2000 date as hard start so that michael will
Have to start moving few days before that, etc.
Regards,
Ravi.
