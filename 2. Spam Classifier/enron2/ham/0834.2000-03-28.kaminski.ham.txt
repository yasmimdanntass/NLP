Subject: update
Hello all,
The program for the 2000 texas finance festival has been formalized and can
Be found on our web site at
I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on san antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left. Second, I need a completed
Application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
Boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
Form.
Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on friday
So plan on arriving early friday or coming in on thursday evening if you
Can. Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
Interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the alamo is across the
Plaza from the hotel).
We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and saturday evenings. The friday evening dinner begins at 6 p. M.
So that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8: 00 p. M. For saturday we are still working out plans for the
Evening so stay tuned.
There will be more information later as the conference nears. Looking
Forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny san antonio.
