Subject: an apology
Kevin -
I need to apologize to you for speaking out - of - turn yesterday about
Work - in - progress. Any model our group has of the natural gas system remains
Completely untested and unvalidated. I have not been asked by any one of my
Superiors, vasant or wince, to give advice to anyone at enron concerning
Natural gas; I am not an expert in trading natural gas. My work exists within
A large and professional group, and, to the point, vince alone will decide
When, and if, any gas model is suitable for dissemination within enron.
Sincerely,
Clayton vernon
Manager, research
