Subject: is this data of interest to any of you?
Fyi:
The following file describes the contents of the monthly energy review
(application, current, and historical).
The data is available through a doe site and we can get it for free and
Incorporate it in the lim database, if there is interest.
Review the attached file (look for keywords of interest) and let us know
Whether need dictates loading these datasets.
For the
Market analysis and infomration management group,
Yannis c. Tzamouranis
