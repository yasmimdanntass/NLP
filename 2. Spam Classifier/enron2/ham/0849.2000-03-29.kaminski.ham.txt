Steve,
Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
At low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
Assuming you can still run it by the analyst/associate program. They closed
The books
For the summer.
Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the research group in
London? One of our analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume
Attached). I' m sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me
Know what you think.
Many thanks,
Steve
