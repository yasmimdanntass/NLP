Subject: thomas knudsen interview
Guys
I' m out of the office until wednesday next week. I' ll chase you up for
Feedback on your video interview with thomas next week (if I don' t get any
From grant before then).
I thought i' d better clear up the fact that you' re the only research people
(except me) to have spoken to thomas so far. Although vince agrees that he' s
A strong candidate, anjam was strongly opposed to thomas' s being brought in
For interview. I thought last night' s video interview was a reasonable way
To get an objective view from other research guys.
Cheers,
Steve
