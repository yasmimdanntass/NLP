Subject: energy derivatives conference - may 29, toronto
Dear mr. Kaminski,
I have just spoken with phelim boyle, who was very pleased to report that
You will be speaking at our energy derivatives conference in toronto on may
29.
I understand that the title of your presentation is" current challenges in
Pricing and risk management of energy derivatives." would you also be
Available and willing to join a panel discussion/question and answer period
At the end of the day?
Speakers, with tentative titles, to follow you are:
Corwin joy (positron, houston)
" modeling physical assets: real option theory applied to generation assets"
David emanuel (williams, tulsa)
" modeling issues in power markets"
Shijie deng (georgia institute of technology, atlanta)
" research on pricing electricity derivatives and the basic models"
Melanie cao (queen' s university, kingston ontario)
" equilibrium pricing of weather derivatives"
Panel discussion
Perhaps ms. Crenshaw could send me your short biographical sketch, by email
Or fax (519) 888 - 7562 so that I can proceed with promoting this event as
Soon as possible.
Many thanks,
Amy
