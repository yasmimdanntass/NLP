Subject: norway visit: research agenda
Dear all,
I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the oslo office
During my visit on friday pm, monday and tuesday. I believe bjarne will be
Available on tuesday, if not monday, and so would like to arrange the trading
And origination meetings for tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go
Through the energydesk issues on monday. I will also give a presentation,
Probably on monday.
Trading: options & volatility curves
It would be useful to meet with the traders along with bjarne' s team to help
Us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in
Trading options (both european and asian). I hope to discuss the vol curves
And will bring the example of the recent work done for the uk electricity
Desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half - hourly
Forward volatility curve have been developed.
Origination:
Any issues arising in complex deals (e. G. Dry reservoir, user - time contracts)
Etc. Perhaps with didrik.
Energydesk. Com
To support the on - going effort to ensure the accuracy of the energydesk. Com
Systems, I hope to help james stephen nail - down the reasons for some of the
Discrepancies between the energydesk. Com valuation and the oslo book (for
This I hope to meet with trond).
Exotic options:
If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll - out the new asian model which
Should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.
I will be in the oslo office from friday afternoon, and available all day
Monday and tuesday. I will be staying at the grand hotel and probably
Contactable on my mobile: 07747 86813.
Look forward to meeting you soon!
Regards,
Anjam
