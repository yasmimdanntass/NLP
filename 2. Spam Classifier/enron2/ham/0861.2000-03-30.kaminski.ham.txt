Subject: jeff skilling does msl 50
Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the
Camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the
Fairgrounds in lagrange!). Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally,
The national multiple sclerosis society' s 2000 man of the year), jeff
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for ms.
Enron' s msl 50 dream team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over
350 enron employees, led by jeff, will ride from houston to austin under the
Enron flag april 15 - 16, and the team' s goal is to raise $350, 000. I am
Challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain
Amount per mile - i. E., $1, $2, $5, it' s your call. I' ll even give you a
Break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though jeff swears it' s
Closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers). Of course, a flat
Pledge is also appreciated. And don' t forget, enron will match your pledge
To this very worthy cause 1 - 1.
I hope you will join the team and help enron maintain its status as the top
Money raiser of all msl 50 rides in the nation! Thank you for your
Consideration. If you have any questions, please don' t hesitate to call me.
