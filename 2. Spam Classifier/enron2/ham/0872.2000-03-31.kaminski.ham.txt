HI zimin!
Please find attached the rpI model I developed by bootstrapping rpI swaps.
The structure of this particular swap is:
Semi/semI act/365 f
>
> yoyukrpI = (ukrpI (p - 2)/ukrpI (p - 14) - 1)/2
> p = payment month
>
The first payment is the latest known historical rpi, february 2000. You will
Notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as
Opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).
Please find below a graphic comparison between the rpI curve produced by
Swaps and the one produced by the gilt market.
Looking forward to your comments.
Best regards,
Martina
