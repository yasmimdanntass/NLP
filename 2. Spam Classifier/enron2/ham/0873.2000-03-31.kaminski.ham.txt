HI martina I believe that the
Forecasts are accurately reflecting this. Please see graphs below:
Both models really need our rpI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just
Copied the 2. 3% number forward). Because the auto - regressive error term is
Not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable
Confidence. As I mentioned, I don' t think we can really run this model more
Than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9 - 12 months and blend the
Next 3 - 4 months out with the long - term model.
Hope I can fix the long - term ones now with some new insight!
Regards,
Anjam
