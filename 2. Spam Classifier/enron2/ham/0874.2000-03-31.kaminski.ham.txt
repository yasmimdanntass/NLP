HI martina & trena,
I think this is a reasonable smoothing method between the short and long - term
Models - let me know if you need me to explain it. I also included the
Short - term models so this is now a self - standing spreadsheet, but probably
Still needs cleaning up a bit.
Zimin & stinson:
We agreed on short - term and long - term models for dzcv and pllu ppI indices in
A meeting with dale and trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the
Results as follows. Blue and red curves are the proposed dzcv and pllu ppi
Index forward curves whilst rpI is the market - derived black curve.
Regards,
Anjam
