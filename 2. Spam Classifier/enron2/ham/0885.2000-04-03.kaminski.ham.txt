Hello vince,
I didn' t know if that was your correct e - mail address listed below on
Receiving from outside the company, so I thought I would forward this with a
Couple of comments.
She states below that she has enclosed a proposal, however, the only pricing
I really see is in the software license agreement, article 2, which states
That the license fee is $100, 000 and lists out when you must pay for it. It
Then states in article 3 that the fees are set forth in appendix 1, but there
Are no prices in appendix 1.
I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going
To prepare it as we usually do to send to mark holsworth for review. In the
Meantime, do you want me to go back to ms. Geman and ask her for more
Detailed pricing information or do you have what you need? Also, in appendix
2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to
Have.
Please let me know.
Thanks,
Karla

Dear ms. Feldman,
Please find enclosed a proposal for the d - g energy
Software license agreement in which enron may be
Interested. We deliberately left blank the appendix 2
Related to the number of sites and workstations it
Would cover, in order to let dr. KaminskI decide what
Is best for enron.
Sincerely
- appendices. Doc
- contract. Doc
