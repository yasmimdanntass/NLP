Subject: re: enron broadband services
Dear stinson,
I apologize for the delay in responding. I was away wed - sun and
Just returned. Thank you very much for your email. I plan to make
A firm decision on my future plans sometime in the later half of
April, and would be extremely interested in getting an offer from
Enron. I think the opportunities at enron are very exciting and
There is room for some real contribution to the group.
Best wishes,
Salal
