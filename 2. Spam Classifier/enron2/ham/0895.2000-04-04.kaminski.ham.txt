Just a quick email to start some discussion about the panel session you are
Involved in during risk 2000 in boston on 13
Similarly it is often interesting to hear the panel' s comments on one
Individual' s more specific area of knowledge.
?
Conseqently if you could return this email (to all panel members) with
Topics you feel should be covered, any particular areas you would personally
Like to focus on, any proposed changes to the actual panel structure, and
Possibly additonal panel members you think should be there, that would be a
Good start. I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if
Anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

Best regards,
