Ms. Crenshaw,
Thank you for sending the bio so quickly. It' s exactly what I was looking
For.
We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution
To the participants. While I will not need dr. Kaminski' s contribution for
Several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be
Very useful to the conference organizers.
I will also need the following information:
- dr. Kaminski' s audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation
- will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on
May 29?
- which nights will he be staying in toronto? I will reserve a room at the
Conference hotel
- any dietary restrictions or special requests
Your help is much appreciated.
Best wishes,
Amy
