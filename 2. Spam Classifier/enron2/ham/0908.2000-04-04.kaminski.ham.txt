Dear ms. Crenshaw,
I am very glad to see professor kaminskI let me meet with him. I offer to
Visit you around 3 p. M. On 17 th monday. I wonder if we can invite him for a
Dinner that night because my colleague mr. Yamada who also wishes to meet
With him will attend a risk publication' s seminar up to 5 p. M. On that day.
Please let professor kaminskI know we understand this offer may affect on
His private time and we do not insist on it. I am very much looking forward
To seeing him.
Best regards,
MasayukI fujita
