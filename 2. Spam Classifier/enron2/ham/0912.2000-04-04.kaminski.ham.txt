Subject: greetings from london (to enron)
Dear dr. Kaminski,
How are you? It was nice to meet you at the real options conference in
Nyc.
I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk. In
Particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options. This is
Something I am interested in as well.
When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
Detail?
Thanks for your time and consideration. Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Iris mack
