Subject: summer rotation in rac
Vince,
I had a lunch meeting with rudI and vladI from rac, and I also met with ted
Murphy.
They are supposed to get back with me by friday to confirm the proposed
Summer rotation.
So far I have a very positive impression of the group, and the projects that
They are involved in.
They also told me that rac and research people are often working on projects
Together, so I am sure that my ties with research are not going to go away
With me rotating to rac.
I will keep you posted on further developments.
Coordially,
Jason sokolov
