Subject: thanks again
Vince and stinson,
I would like to thank you for helping me trying to find an internship. I
Really appreciate the attention you gave to me.
I am happy to tell you that I found an internship in my area of interest
With mfrgroup. It is a consulting company that provides management
Consulting, advisory, finance, operations management and information
Technology services. I will be helping them to develop a new business
Related with e - commerce b - to - b.
From now on, I will be concentrating my efforts in finding a full time
Position, because I will graduate at the end of the year. I do not want to
Miss enron' s deadline, and I am still very interested in enrononline
Business. Please keep me updated if any opportunity arises.
Thanks again
