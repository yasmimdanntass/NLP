Subject: copy room
To whom it may concern:
I would like to know who will be responsible for keeping up with
The copy room near my area. Eb 32 copy rooml
I am aware that this is something that must be decided by
Whoever is in charge however, I would like to participate in keeping this
Room operational.
Please note that I use this room more often than anyone else
And I pay more attention to what is needed there on a daily basis.
I am not asking for full charge over the room but I would like to assist
Whereby, it will always be operational.
Thanks
Kevin moore
