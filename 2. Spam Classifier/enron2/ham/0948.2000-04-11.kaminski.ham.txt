Zimin,
This is the course description I got from hal. Can you follow up with him
To schedule a date for a high level presentation? I think we should keep
It to only 90 minutes or so. Maybe you and kevin kindall can be the
Presenters.

Stinson, I feel I would benefit from understanding the monte carlo techniques
And what it applies to, as well as when it is used these mc techniques. I think
I could get several people interested. Thanks, hal

Hal,
Actually, I am no longer scheduled to speak at the risk conference on m - c
Techniques. We could probably put together an internal training for you if
You want. I' ll bring this up with vince at our staff meeting tomorrow.
It would be helpful if you can describe for me the intended audience and the
Types of applications that would interest them.
Thanks,
