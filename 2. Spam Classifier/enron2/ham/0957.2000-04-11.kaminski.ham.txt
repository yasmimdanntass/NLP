Dear mr. Fujita:
I will be glad to make the dinner arrangements. I will make reservations at
The" latour d' argent" restaurant located at 2011 ella blvd at t. C. Jester.
For 6: 30 pm on the 17 th. They do require a coat.
I believe most of the cabs will know where it is - but just in case:
" take I - 45 north to 610 east, go to the ella blvd exit and turn left (back
Under the freeway) on ella blvd. Go to 2011 ella blvd. (on the right)."
Look forward to having you at enron.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Shirley crenshaw
