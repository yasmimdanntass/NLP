Subject: visit?
Dear vince,
I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
 see
Http:// www. Stern. Nyu. Edu/~fdiebold.
The upshot: it seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
Extensive conversation. I
Would be happy to visit you in houston to learn more about your
Operations, and to tell you more
About mine. Please do let me know if you are interested.
Best regards,
Frank diebold
