Jana,
" cotton mary" sounds good. It' s a film by ismail merchant who collaborated
On" a room with a view"," howard' s view", and other well known movies.
It' s a story about two anglo - indian sisters.

Vince,
The angelika has several movies that would be good. I am familiar with all
But one - -" cotton mary." do you know anything about it?
If you still haven' t seen" american beauty", that is fine with us. Just let
Me know what sounds good to you. We are flexible when it comes to movies.
