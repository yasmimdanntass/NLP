Subject: resume, cv., etc.
Dear mr. Kaminski:
As explained over the phone, I have been doing political, economic, and
Strategic analysis for terry thorn, formerly head of government affairs for
Ei. Most of my work has been focussed on asia, a region in which I have deep
Experience and speak major languages. Wtih the restructuring of the
Asia - pacific group, terry is moving to a new function and I am seeking a new
Role. Since I have been based in washington, dc, with more frequent trips to
Asia than to houston, I still feel as though I don' t know my way around the
Company, a disadvantage in my current situation. Several people have
Recommended that I talk to you about your shop, but more generally if you
Have any ideas about where I might fit in, I would appreciate them.
I am attaching my resume, cv and a biographical sketch as you requested,
Edith terry
Enron/dc
