I think full time employment starting in about six months seems to be the
Best option. It is probably best to get my dissertation wrapped up before
Taking on additional commitments.

Zeigham,
We discussed two options (not necessarily mutually exclusive):
1. Summer internship
2. Full employment.
Are you interested exclusively in full employment?
I need the answer asap, as we are going to discuss the additional summer
Intern positions this afternoon.

Vince:
It was very nice talking to you at the texas finance festival and I think
The telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very
Lucrative. I would be very interested in working in that segment for
Enron.
However, I talked to sheridan about this oppurtunity and he said that it
Is probably going to be another six months before I finish my
Dissertation. So while I am definitely interested, the start date will
Probably have to be around that time.
At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again and hopefully once I have
Defended my dissertation we can discuss employment oppurtunities in
Greater detail.
