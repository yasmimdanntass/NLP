Zeigham,
We discussed two options (not necessarily mutually exclusive):
1. Summer internship
2. Full employment.
Are you interested exclusively in full employment?
I need the answer asap, as we are going to discuss the additional summer
Intern positions this afternoon.

Subject: hi
Vince:
It was very nice talking to you at the texas finance festival and I think
The telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very
Lucrative.? I would be very interested in working in that segment for enron.
?
However, I talked to sheridan about this oppurtunity and he said that it is
Probably going to be another six months before I finish my dissertation.? So
While I am definitely interested, the start date will probably have to be
Around that time.?
?
At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again and hopefully once I have
Defended my dissertation? We can discuss employment oppurtunities in greater
Detail.
