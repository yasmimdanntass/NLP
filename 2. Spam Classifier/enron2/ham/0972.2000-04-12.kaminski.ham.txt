HI trushar
Please find attached our draft analysis. It is still very preliminary as we
Have not been provided the latest version of legal documents and so the
Analysis
Reflects our understanding of the economics of the transaction as outlined to
Us
Based on discussions with enron and available prior draft documentation..
The analysis uses the enron share price as of march 28, 2000 ($72. 81) and
Assumes the ljm 2 distribution is based on $30 m or 25% irr. We anticipated
That
This might reach 30% irr based on enron discussions with ljm 2.
Please call steve stampf' s phone number for tomorrow' s conference call at
9. 30 am
Our time on 212 597 3162.
