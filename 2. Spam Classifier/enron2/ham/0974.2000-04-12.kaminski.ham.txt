It' s ready.

Vince:
I am working now in ees as the chase national account manager and am
Developing new products to sell chase. One of the products I am working on
Integrates the provision of broad band with a package of computer
Hardware and software for a company' s employees.
I can explain more if you are interested.
I understand you put together a report on broadband which has helped educate
People as to the technology and economics. Can I get a copy?.
Also do you have any analyses on chase that might help me detect other
Opportunities?
Is there anyone on your staff with whom I should talk?
Thanks
Chris
