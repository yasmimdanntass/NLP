At the core of ees , s success has been our willingness to adapt to and embrace
Change. Tom and I are reminded of this again as we announce the departure of
John echols, whose extraordinary capabilities have been instrumental to the
Successful launch of ees, and to our tremendous growth in the two - and - a - half
Years since then. John is continuing his career at enron.
Marty sunde, currently managing director of sales joe earle, president
And ceo of enron facility services; kevin hughes, vice president and chief
Accounting officer; dan leff, managing director of account and delivery
Management; danny mccarty, managing director of ees - europe; mark muller,
Managing director of corporate development; vickI sharp, managing director
And general counsel; and beth tilney, managing director of marketing,
Communications and human resources.
Thank you for your continued commitment to ees. We , ve just completed a great
Quarter and are well positioned to meet or exceed our targets this year! In
Fact, this is the seventh consecutive quarter for record levels of new
Contracting activity and we , ve more than doubled our first quarter sales of
1999. Keep up the great work!
