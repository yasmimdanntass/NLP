Subject: research group, recruiting
Celeste,
I attach some brief job candidate descriptions for the types of people we are
Looking for at the bs/ms level.
Osman sezgen (supporting ees) and p. V. Krishnarao (supporting ees, ebs, and
Gpg) both said that they are willing to help in interviewing, recruiting, or
Reviewing resumes. I also would make myself available (ebs, ena) and
Would be especially willing to help at the schools I attended, caltech and
Rice (both on your target list).
Let us know what we can do to help.
Best regards,
