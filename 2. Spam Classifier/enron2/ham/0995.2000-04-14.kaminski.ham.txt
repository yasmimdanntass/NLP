Subject: gas & power marketing & trading study
Vincent,
I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing our gas & power
Marketing & trading study. We really hope that enron is able to participate
This year and we will work with you to address your concerns. I believe
That the problem last year was primarily due to concerns over releasing data
In general and not our study in particular.
I am attaching an electronic copy of the latest version of the input sheet
For the study. It is far easier to read on a computer than in print.
Please remember that enron does not need to answer every question to
Participate and that all results are reported back in a blinded format. The
Only data points identified by company are the data points for the company
Values of the company receiving the report.
If you have any further questions regarding the report, please do not
Hesitate to call john stephenson or myself at (713) 523 - 8001. Have a great
Weekend and thank you for your efforts to enable enron to participate in
This year' s study.
Sincerely,
Richard murphy
