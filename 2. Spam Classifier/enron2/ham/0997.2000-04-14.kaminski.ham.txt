Subject: monday' s newsletter
Hello vince!
I' m working with michael sergeev to produce this next issue of the
Newsletter. Do you have a suggestion for the kaminskI column on page one?
If so, please tell me what you' d like to use and i' ll get it ready either
Today or monday morning.
At some point, when you have a couple of minutes, we should sit down and talk
About your philosophy regarding the newsletter and what you would like to see
In the future. I' d like to get a little creative with it once I know your
Thoughts on this.
Best regards,
Sam
P. S. - note that I am" william smith" in the lotus notes system. There is
Also a" will smith" that works in it. We forward each other' s mail all the
Time!: -)
