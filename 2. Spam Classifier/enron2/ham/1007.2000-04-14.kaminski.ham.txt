Dear mr. Mcsherry:
I am responding to your search for credit risk professionals on
The
Enroncredit. Com website. After working for seven years on credit
Risk
Management in a research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer
My
Experience in assessing credit risk modeling, information technology
And
Methodology in complex top - tier institutions to an active credit
Trading
Managerial environment. I am excited about being involved in
Trading,
Origination, risk management and r & d of credit derivatives.
I have seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and
Management. I
Have helped design, test and implement credit value - at - risk systems with
Kmv
Corp and with a major japanese bank. I was a major contributor at kmv
In
Designing the expected default frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar
With
Its assumptions, strengths, weaknesses and applications. I did the
Empirical
Research that lies behind the kmv default correlation model, the private
Firm
Edf model and I interfaced with j. P. Morgan (now r. M. G.) personnel during
The
Creation of the creditmetrics documentation.
I have excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming
Skills.
I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied
Credit
Risk theory while I worked with kmv and arthur andersen. I am eager to join
The
Credit derivative team at enroncredit. Com where I am certain that my
Combination
Of quantitative research skills, credit risk consulting experience
And
Technology expertise make me uniquely qualified to support the
Credit
Derivatives trading and risk management function.
I have included my resume with this e - mail. Please e - mail me or call me
At
201 - 420 - 0191 (home) and 212 - 708 - 4027 (work) so that we can discuss
This
Opportunity further.
