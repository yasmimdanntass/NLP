Subject: meeting with vince set for 1 pm monday, april 17
Maureen, thank you very much for taking time away from your project to talk
With me this morning. Since the management decision to close info central, i
Have been doing small projects that, while necessary, do not require my
Education, knowledge or research capabilities.
I appreciate your suggestion that I speak to vince since I am anxious to
Return to contributing at a higher level. I am attaching my resume in the
Hope that it will trigger ideas for possible ways that I can use my abilities
In the research department. I have worked as an information specialist for
14 years, doing research for people at all levels in both the pharmaceutical
And energy industries. I have focused most heavily on business research, but
Learn quickly and can branch out in whatever direction necessary for a
Project.
I' m looking forward to meeting with vince on monday afternoon. Thanks again
For your help.
