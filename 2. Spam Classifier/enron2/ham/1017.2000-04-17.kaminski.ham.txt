Subject: thomas knudsen: interviews cancelled
Dear all,
I just got a call from thomas who wants to cancel the interviews scheduled
For today - he told me that he would call me at the beginning of may (after
His holidays) to arrange them. I did mention that there was a risk that the
Position may be filled by then, but he seemed unperturbed by this.
Regards,
Anjam
