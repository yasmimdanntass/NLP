Stinson,
I have received the offer, thank you. I am looking forward to being there
Again and getting involved in some interesting projects. I bet it will be
Fun.
As to when I can start, I think I can start around the end of may. I can
Give you a more precise date after I figure out the schedule regarding my
Assistanship obligations.
Ps: could you give some idea about the kind of projects that we' ll be
Working on? I might do some advance reading if you could point out some
References.
Best regards,
Cantekin
