Margaret,
First of all I apologize for not sending you the information to complete the
Chart that you gave me. I have been travelling because of work and then
Vacation, maybe I spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4
Weeks. Now that I am going through my to do list I cannot find that page
That you gave me. Could you please send it to me again?
On the other hand I was wondering if maybe within enron possibly at info
Central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a
Copy of a book titled: chicago board of trade commodity
Trading manual
Isbn: 1579580025
Publisher: fitzroy dearborn publishers, incorporated
Pub. Date: december 1997
It sI not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long
Time to deliver. I need this bbok in order to produce a document that steve
Kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago.
Thank you very much for your help.
Best,
Ricardo
