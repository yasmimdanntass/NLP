Nick:
We are unable to get a vc location for 10: 30 am, however, we can have one
At 11: 00 am. Houston time. Is there anyway that we could push the interview
To 11: 00 am? I know you have to make reservations for your conference room
Also. If not, we will have to do a phone interview.
Please let me know.
Thanks!
