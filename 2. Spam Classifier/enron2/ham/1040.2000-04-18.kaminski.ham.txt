Kevin,
If you guys had aerons (mesh) and/or vecta (leather) chairs, my group
Typically will not be responsible for the replacement of those chairs as i' m
Not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone. My group
Does not stock these chairs, therefore we order as requested by business
Units and charge your co/rc. There will be two chairs delivered to the
Locations mentioned below, however, they will not be the vecta or aeron
Chairs.
You may want to contact enron security and maybe they can investigate further.
Thanks,
Reggie

HI reggie,
We spoke regarding the chairs on monday.
Please, we need these chairs as soon as possible, without being charged.
We paid for all new chairs each time we moved and it' s not fair we pay again.
Thanks
Kevin moore
P. S. These chairs were taken.........

Reggie,
There may already be a request floating around for a standard black office
Chair for ebl 972 d. It was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago. In
Addition to that one, my own chair at eb 3132 a was stolen this past weekend.
Could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us?
If you need to charge them to us, our numbers are 0011 and 100038. As
Always, call me if you need to at x 58322.
Thanks!
Sam smith
