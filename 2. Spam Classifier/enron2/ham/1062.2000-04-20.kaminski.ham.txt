Subject: masayukI fujita from the mitsubishI research institute
I have been at enron for eight months and work under sally beck.
In december I attended the exotic energy derivatives conference, where I met
MasayukI fujita from the mitsubishI research institute. He is doing research
On the deregulation of the japanese power market. We had lunch together and
Chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a japanese company for 8
1/2 years and speak fluent japanese, so we got along easily).
He was in houston this week and came by to visit. On monday, we met with
Vince kaminskI and grant masson and later had dinner with them. Sally
Suggested that I introduce him to alan aronowitz and you. Of course, you
Were out of town, but we did meet with alan who said you would probably want
To meet him back in tokyo anyway.
Would you like for me to set something up?
Regards,
Eugenio
