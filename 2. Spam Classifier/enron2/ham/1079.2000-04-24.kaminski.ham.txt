Subject: last day notification
Shelia walton, hr, told me that my last day with my department will be june
30. Meanwhile I talked last week to ebs, enrononline, and ees. I was most
Interested in the ees talk with harold buchanan who needs to know that he has
The most complete list of potential customers and then information about
Those customers.
Any happenings from your talks?
