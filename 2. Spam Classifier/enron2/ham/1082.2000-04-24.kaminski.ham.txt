Rick,
Aram is coming to houston, in my view, to explore the possibility of coming
Back to enron
(given uncertain situation under the scottish rule at the old pacificorp).
I shall suggest that he meet with you and/or ted murphy as well.
I can wait for karen to come back. It' s not urgent. We are still working on
The volumetric risk module and the team is making a very good progress.
They gave a presentation today to rick carson and me.
We have to decide what comes next (asset/liability model or
Operational risk model).
