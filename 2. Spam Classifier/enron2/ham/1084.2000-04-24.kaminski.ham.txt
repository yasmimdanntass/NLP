Subject: uh lecture and potential career opportunity
Dr. Masson,
I attended your lecture at uh and enjoyed it tremendously. If possible, i
Would like to investigate a career opportunity with your group in particular
Or enron in general. Would you please review my resume and/or forward to
Potentially interested parties?
In tandem will all of enron' s other propaganda efforts, your top - notch
Lecture at uh spurred me to do some soul searching. I currently work at
Duke energy trading and marketing, but have been extremely impressed with
Enron' s cutting - edge research and market - leading position.
I have a ph. D in electrical engineering from rice (statistical signal
Processing) with two years of experience at duke relating to the valuation,
Risk management, and risk measurement of financial derivatives and physical
Assets. I seek a similar position that would allow me to leverage my
Quantitative skills and grow within in the corporation.
I believe I would be a great fit with enron and hope you would consider me
For a potential position.
Best regards,
Matt crouse
