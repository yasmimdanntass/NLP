Subject: re: real options conference in cambridge
Steve
Given the practitioner audience, I would prefer a less technical
Presentation. Perhaps if you can talk about use of real options at enron in
General, and then give some examples (graphically - - no notation) of
Diagrammatic representation might be good. Remember there are many talks
And the capacity of the audience to absorb notation, grammar, and technical
Detail is limited.
How about a more generic title" real options at enron?"
Please give me your title within enron please
