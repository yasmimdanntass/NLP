I' d like to give a talk entitled" diagrammatic representation of real options
In enron", in which I will give a brief run - down of a diagrammatic technique
I have developed for representing real option deals. My notation allows
Originators, managers and quants to communicate unambiguously, while still
Appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality. I have defined
A" diagrammatic grammar" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal
Follows immediately and automatically from the diagram.
I propose to introduce the symbols and grammar, then go on to present some
Suitable examples of diagrams. If appropriate i' ll talk about the links with
Dynamic programming. (I will need some guidance as to how much technical
Detail I can go into based on the audience.)
All the best,
