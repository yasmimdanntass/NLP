Subject: video conference for interview: stig faltinsen
HI vince,
This candidate was forwarded from the norway office. He is finishing his phd
In cambridge but is available soon. If you are free on thursday before the
Regular weekly meeting that would be good - would 3 pm or 4 pm work for you
(9 am or 10 am your time) to set up the video interview?
Regards,
Anjam
