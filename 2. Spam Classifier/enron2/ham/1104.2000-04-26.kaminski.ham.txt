Subject: e & p model
Vince - attached is the most recent e & p version of the old corporate cash
Flow model that I could find. Note that" most recent" still dates it back a
Few years. A couple caveats: I did try to clean it up somewhat from old
Macros, but no guarntees offered. Also, some of the underlying methodology
Is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic
Processes, and perhaps decline rates.
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.
