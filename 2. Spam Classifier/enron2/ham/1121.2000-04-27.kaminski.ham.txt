Vince:
I talked to this guy briefly. I think he is desparate to get out of unocal
Before they downsize him out of a job.
He has a decent resume and the attached comment from don winslow is
Interesting.

Grant - here' s the resume of the guy that called. Sorry for the delay. Here
Are don winslow' s comments:
" greg was my predecessor in the risk mgt dept at unocal. He reminds me
Somewhat of remi' s cousin - mild mannered, physics phd. He is brilliant and
Expresses himself well. I think he might fit in vince' s group better than
In your group. He has not had much exposure to commercial transactions. He
Was in bill bradford' s mba class. He graduated #1."
