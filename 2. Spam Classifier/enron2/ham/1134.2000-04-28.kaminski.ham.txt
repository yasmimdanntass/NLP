Subject: some municipal bonds for you to look at.....
I called out munI desk to have them take a look at the current munis avaiable
That looked best at this time to invest $50, 000 going out to 30 years for
You. The following is what they came up with....
Pecos co tx cert of obl w/a coupon 5. 5% matures in 02/01/11 callable at par
On 02/01/07 offered at $101. 964 - aaa rated

Houston tx air revs w/a coupon of 5. 00% maturing in 07/01/28 callable at par

Remember, these are subject to change, but if these interest you and they are
Not still available, I will see if there is something comparable.
