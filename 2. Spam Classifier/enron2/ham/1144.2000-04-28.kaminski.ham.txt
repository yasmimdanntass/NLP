Subject: move locations
Sorry,
The churn has been turned in as of 4/15/00 therefore locations
Are as follows.
Tricia tlapek - eb 3273 a
Vince kaminskI - eb 3273 b
Sam smith - eb 3273 c
Michael sergeev - eb 3274 a
Jason sokolov - eb 3274 b
Vacant - eb 3274 c
This is where all equipment and items should be labelled.
I am so sorry that we could not make changes on short notice.
Thanks
Kevin moore
