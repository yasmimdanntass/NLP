Anjam,
It makes sense to come to houston for a longer time period.
I think that you should spend here at least 3 weeks.

Vince, dale
Here are our proposals for houston visits from our group:
Kirstee all of july, all of september. (kirstee' s personal commitments mean
She needs to be in the uk for august.)
Ben all of october. (no crossover with kirstee, ensures var/credit cover
In london office.)
Steve 2 - 3 weeks in july, first 3 weeks of september.
Anjam to be arranged at anjam and houston' s mutual convenience.
Matt not a permanent research group member. I' m asking richard' s group to
Pay for his visit, probably in august.
