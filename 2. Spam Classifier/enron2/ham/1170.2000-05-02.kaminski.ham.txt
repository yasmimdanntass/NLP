Subject: visit to enron
Grant and vince,
Thanks for arranging my visit to enron. I was impressed by the nature and
Scope of work in the group and the people I met. I look forward to hearing
From you later in the week.
A few peple asked me the method I used to value asian options. It is an
Approximate method based on geometrical averaging with an adjusted exercise
Price, as described by gordon gemmill in option pricing: an international
Perspective, mcgraw - hill, london, 1993, pages 242 - 248.
Regards,
Greg
