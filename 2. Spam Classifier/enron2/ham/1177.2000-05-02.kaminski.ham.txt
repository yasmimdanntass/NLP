Ehud,
Sorry I shall miss you on thursday.
I shall definitely attend you presentation at power 2000.
I shall ask about a guest accounton eol. Typically, such an account allows
An outside user to take a look at the system, but I don' t think the traders
Will allow
Systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third
Party.

Vince,
Greetings.
I am following up at this time with respect to the above issues we
Discussed in san antonio.
1. I am leaving thur. Morn for philadelphia, and shall not be back until
Late fri. (my etd is 9: 40 a. M., which I understand is less than an hour
Before your arrival...) thus I shall regrettably miss your current ut
Visit, which we had hoped to also use as an opportunity to present/discuss
My enterprise - wide risk management model.
2. That said, I shall be presenting an abridged version of this model at
Power 2000' s first day, 5/9 4: 15 - 4: 55 p. M. While I realize you' ll be
Very busy over power 2000' s two days, should your schedule permit, I should
Most welcome the opportunity for you to see the model.
3. Per your suggestion in san antonio, I would like to take this
Opportunity to inquire whether I might obtain an enron on - line account to
Obtain electricity prices quoted by enron.
I look forward to seeing you at power 2000. Best regards,
Ehud
