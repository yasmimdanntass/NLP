Subject: making room for" summer interns"
Hello all:
I have some" good" news and I have some" bad" news. The" good" news
Is that we are growing! The" bad" news is that we are running out of space.
Therefore, just for the summer we need to use jose' s and joe' s offices
On the 19 th floor for" summer" interns.
I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won' t be
Ringing all the time. However, we can put them back after the summer is
Over.
I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with roman and jason needing
Spaces on the 19 th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left
Without any extra spaces.
Thanks!
Shirley
