Subject: re: real options
Vince,
Thanks again for coming to austin to speak with my class. I am sure
That they appreciated hearing about the use of real options at enron, and i
Think it was a very fine way to finish the semester.
Along with my colleagues from finance, I appreciate the strong
Support that enron has provided to the college of business administration.
We appreciate the relationship, and look forward to seeing you in austin
Again next year.
Jim
