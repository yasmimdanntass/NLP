Dear vince kaminski,
I was auditing prof dyer' s real options class on thursday when you spoke
On enron' s activities in this area. I would be interested in exploring the
Possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
And in anticipation of enron' s business requirements. I' m currently
Working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger. In particular i' ll be speaking at an industry real options
Valuation conference in london (http:// www. Iqpc. Co. Uk/finance/rov /) and i
Just had the paper accepted for publication in operations research. Could
You pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?
Thanks in advance,
Chris kenyon
