Dear professor duffie,
I enclosed with this e - mail enron storage analysis model (sam) for your
Review. The attached files include:
1) a brief documentation of the model (sam. Doc), 2) c - code of the main
Routines, 3) excel spreadsheet interface,
4) sam _ audit. Dll.
Dr. Vince kaminski, dr. Stinson gibner and myself have spent about one year
In developing this model.
With traders , feedback incorporated, the model results are close to reality.
Although there are features to be included,
We believe the model is ready for your review. We look forward to your
Comments and suggestions.
Please feel free to contact me should you need additional detail.
