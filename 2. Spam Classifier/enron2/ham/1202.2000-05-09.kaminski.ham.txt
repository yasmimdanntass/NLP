Hello shirley,
I' d understood from yannis that he' d proposed a brown bag lunch where i' d
Give a talk and then the discussion about various possibilities would
Follow. I' m here until about mid - may and then will go on leave in europe
For a year. I could be available to make trips back and forth from time to
Time to get things started.
Best regards,
Joe mccauley
