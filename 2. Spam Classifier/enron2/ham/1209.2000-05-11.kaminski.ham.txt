Subject: steve' s trip to houston
Dale, richard,
I am ready to cover the cost of steve' s trip to houston (one month in the
Summer).
I think very highly of steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
Horizons. I see him as a very valuable asset of enron and a great leader
In not too distant future. He needs exposure to more diverse business
Problems and areas of research. I think it will be in the best interest of
The company
To devote some resources to foster his development.
