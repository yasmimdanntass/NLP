Subject: re: summer visits
Steve,
I can pick up the cost of your trip from the research group budget.
The more I think about it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult
To justify 2 trips per person. I think that we should go for one contiguous
Stay per person and make a good
Effort to make these trips productive.

Vince
Thanks for offering to look my presentation over. The deadline for
Submission has been extended until tomorrow (friday), so there' s less of a
Hurry.
As regard our summer visits, we' ll need to speak to dale over the budget.
Personal commitments mean it' s difficult for me to take two whole months to
Visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter
Visit. I' d obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the
Only way I can do it. I believe the situation is similar for kirstee.
I' ve persuaded richard to pay for matt' s visit in its entirety, and i' ve no
Doubt that rac/credit trading will pick up the bills for ben and kirstee.
It' s difficult to think who' d be the natural group to pay for me. I honestly
Think i' ll have difficulty persuading, e. G. Richard, that it' s worth his
While to pay for my visit. I get the impression he thinks i' m doing ok
Without the need to go to houston for further training.
I' m interviewing a candidate for bjorn' s model review role during today' s
Videoconference, so we' ll need to speak beforehand or perhaps friday.
All the best,
Steve
