Celeste,
As you may know, brad romine' s dot. Com venture fell apart.
The offer from enron looks much better now. I have arranged for him
A number of different interviews (including one with you). I think we should
Not be too
Punitive and give him the 2 nd chance. I am setting up for him interviews with
Rac,
Ebs and greg whalley and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.
Please, give me a call if you have any other question.
