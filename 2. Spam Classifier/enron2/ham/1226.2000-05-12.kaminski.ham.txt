Subject: recommendation for john gordon
Dear vince,
I am writing to bring to your attention a gsia student, john gordon, who is
Currently being considered for enron' s associates program. My understanding
Is that mark courtney and andrew miles at enron are championing john as a
Late addition to the program.
While I know enron doesn' t routinely recruit at gsia, john would be an ideal
Candidate if you are willing to make an exception. He is a terrific finance
Student with a strong transcript; including an a + in my options class. Since
John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional
Background reading about finance and energy. John is personable and
Outgoing. Normally the job market for someone of john' s caliber would have
Already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at
Play here.
I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at john. A copy of
His resume is attached to this email.
Best regards,
Duane
