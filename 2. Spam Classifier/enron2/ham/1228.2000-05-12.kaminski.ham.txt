Nick,
The airport is about 30 minutes by cab from the office (1400 smith).
The best hotel is either hyatt regency downtown or doubletree
Downtown (it is important to emphasize downtown when making
Reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
From the enron building.
We can make reservations for dinner around 6: 30 - 7: 00
In a resturant within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.
By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related
Expenses.
Vince

Vince,
Yes, that would be ideal. But let me call first my travel agent to
See if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
Constraints. What time should I be at enron on thursday, and how far is
The airport from your offices?
Thanks,
Nick
