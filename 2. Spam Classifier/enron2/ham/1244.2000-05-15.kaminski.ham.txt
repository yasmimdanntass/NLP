Subject: re: recommendation for john gordon
Vince,
Thanks for your quick action on this. I try to be selective about sending
Out recommendations proactively, but in john' s case I am very confident that
He will add a lot of value to whoever hires him. On a different topic I was
Pleased to see that you will also be on the eprm program again in the fall.
