Subject: thank you for power 2000
HI vince
Just wanted to thank you for your participation at power 2000 last week and
For contributing to the success of the conference. The feedback we received
Was absolutely glowing and we were delighted with the smooth - running of the
Event. Thank you for being a key part of that. As always, your presentations
Went down extremely well and your presence at our events makes a big
Difference, as people are alwyas keen to hear both form you personally and
From enron as a company.
As I mentioned to you, I have recently been given the responsibility of
Creating and developing a new conference stream in the financial technology
Sector under the waters brand, so I would like to take this opportunity to
Say how much I have enjoyed working with you in the past couple of years and
To wish you the best of luck in the future. Please stay in touch and if you
Come to new york, please let me know so I can take you out for a drink!
Best regards and thank you again both for your patience in helping me
Research topics and for being so willing to participate at our events.
Emma
