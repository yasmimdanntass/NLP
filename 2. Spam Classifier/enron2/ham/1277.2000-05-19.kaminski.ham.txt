Subject: re: cplex floating license
Chonawee and I just had a phone conversation with cplex. There are other
Alternatives (products) that may help in saving time and cost. Chonawee and i
Feel that one floating develoment license, and one or two opl (a package on
Sale that provides modeling and optimization features) licenses will do. In
Addition, we need floating deployment licenses. For the development licenses,
The charges should be split" equally" between the different groups that may
Ask for optimization help (although it is hard to predict who may ask for
Future help). We are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to
Develop the needed solution but are not (in general) used to run the
Software. The deployment licenses can be charged on per - use basis for
Different groups.
Cplex is going to send us a new quote. We' ll make the decision soon after
That.
