Hi,
I have tested both cplex and xpress - mp optimization software in solving our
Network design problem.
Xpress is more user friendly hence it takes less developing time. However,
Cplex performs significantly better
In term of computation time, especially in integer programming.
As a result, eventhougth xpress is easier to use and cheaper, I would
Recommend our ebs group to use cplex.
Please let me know what do you think...
The test problem has 10 nodes, 77 cables, 5 cable speed.
The table below represents the computation time in seconds for solving this
Problem.
The second column indicates if the general integer variables are relaxed (but
Still keep the binary variables).
The" lp" column represents the computational time when solving relaxed
Problem (no binary & integer variable constraints).
Xpress took too much time in solving case 4 and 6 so I had to stop the
Process and report the best solutions it found.
Below are the graph.
