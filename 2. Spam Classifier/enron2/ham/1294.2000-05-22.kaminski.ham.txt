Subject: re: credit. Com cv' s
My feedback:
Philip has an excellent cv and background - - - phd coursework at university
Of chicago, and work experience at long term capital (hopefully he learned
Something). His views are somewhat idealistic - - - his aim is to make
Bid - offers in any product, and he could not really address how he would
Handle illiquidity. Nevertheless, if bryan needs traders, he can fit the
Role.
Zak seemed somewhat unfocused. He has worked on a variety of projects, but
Does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do. He
Seemed very academically oriented, and might be hard to communicate and work
With. I do not see him working in the trenches, and I do not see him leading
The group either. He would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with.
