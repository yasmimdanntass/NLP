Dear mr. Kaminski:
How are you doing?
I called you on may 11 th about my first rotational assignment. You
Recommended risk management and asked me to email you my resume.
It seems like risk management group are not very interested in me,
Because
I
Haven' t received any feedback from them yet. Do you think I should wait
For
A few days or call them?
I do appreciate your help, which will make a difference on my career
Path.
Sincerely
Xiaojun george huan
