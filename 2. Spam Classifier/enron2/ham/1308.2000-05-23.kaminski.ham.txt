Steve,
The journal of risk is a more technical and serious publication
Than risk magazine.
If the article is published it will give you more exposure in
The academic circles. I think it will be a significant
Accomplishment.
On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as risk
Among the practitioners.
I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
By navroz: the article is fairly long for risk.

Steven,
After further consultation with the technical editor, we feel that your work
Would find a more suitable environment for exposure in the journal of risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the editor - in - chief, philippe jorion)
And outline what has happened to:
?
? Pjorion@ uci. Edu
?
Then I am sure that they will be keen to give due consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming to this
Decision.
?
Best wishes,
?
Navroz patel,
Technical assistant, risk magazine.
