Subject: managing energy price risk articles
HI vince, I have a quick question for you. The eol folks want to put a
Couple of articles from the risk book (managing energy price risk) on the
Internet. I told them that would be a copywrite violation. Is there
Someone at risk they could call to get permission for this, or is it even
Worth calling? Thanks
Ross
