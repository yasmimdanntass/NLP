I agree. I (or chonawee) will go ahead and place the order for cplex. I think
That this will provide us with a great set of tools.

I talked to vince about the optimization software issue. Vince said that if
There are technical reasons for having two different packages and the
Benefits outweigh the costs of maintaining two licenses, we can go ahead and
Buy both. In my view, it is a great advantage to have both, as each has its
Own strengths relative to the other. We have spent some time trying to come
Up with one package that solves all of our problmes without success. There is
No point is wasting more time on this effort. Let' s go ahead and purchase
Both.

Tom,
Vince prefers to have one software package (if possible). It is my
Understanding that special ordered sets are recognized automatically
(internally) by cplex. This seems to be the case for both cplex and osl
According to ampl' s web page and other references (check
Lorderedsetsfeature). As a result, the cplex people feel that there is no
Need to provide the user with the tools to represent special - ordered sets in
Opl. As a matter of fact, the incapability of xpress to recognize them
Automatically concerns me.
If you have special requirements, c code may be used to pass the information
To the solver (which is straight forward; all of chonawee' s testing was done
This way). Chonawee' s benchmark shows a superior performance by cplex (which
You indicated yourself in an earlier message).
If you feel that xpress is the only way to go, then feel free to purchase it
(the purchase order is on hold for the time being). However, we need to check
With vince first. I strongly feel that we should have one solver in order to
Minimize cost and contractual headaches.
Let us try to get this issue resolved by this afternoon. Thanks.
