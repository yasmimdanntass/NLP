Stinson,
Krishna mentioned that tom wants to buy (may have bought) xpress. Tom' s
Argument is that xpress' s language allows the user to express special ordered
Sets (certain types of constraints) in a convenient fashion. Chonawee and i
Just talked to two of cplex' s consultants (whom I know personally). They both
Mentioned that these sets are recognized and handled implicitly within cplex.
As a result, there is no need for their modeling language to express these
Constraints explicitly.
As a result, I feel that we should go with cplex. Both chonawee and krishna
Seem to have the same impression. I need to get a final vote on this one so
That we can order the licenses. This has been dragging on for too long.
