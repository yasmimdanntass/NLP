Subject: risk 2000 panel discussion
Dear all,
?
Would like to set a conference call to discuss content for the panel
Discussion at risk 2000 in boston on 14 june. Perhaps I can suggest
Wednesday 31 may at noon est. I' m on london time and am quite flexible if
You would like to do earlier or indeed on another day.
?
The panellists are -
?
Vince kaminski, enron corp
Richard jefferis, koch energy trading
Steven bramlet, aquila
?
The discussion topic is' effectively applying weather derivatives'
?
I think we need to establish a series of questions around which to
Facilitate discussion. We currently don' t have a moderator and perhaps one
Of you could take this role on.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
Thanks, oliver
