Subject: here' s your chance
What do we need to know to make ebs a successful business?
We need to identify 5 to 10 critical issues in order to help m. I. T. Professor
Gabriel bitran get his students focused on areas of interest to ebs.
Your suggestions for interesting and useful research topics are due by next
Wednesday morning, may 31. Tom gros will then forward the topics to
Professor bitran.
