Subject: final dates for houston visits
Dear all,
Shirley has kindly arranged the accommodation for these new dates - i' d be
Grateful if we could stick to the dates that you confirmed to me below as it
Will be next to impossible to change these again. Of course, it should be
Fine for you to arrive a day early to lose your jet lag and depart a day late
So that you get a full week in the office.
Matthew williams mon 31 st july through friday 18 th august
Steve leppard mon 21 st aug through frI 15 th sep
Kirstee hewitt mon 18 th sep through friday 13 th oct
Ben parsons mon 16 th oct through friday 10 th nov
Let me know if you have any more logistical questions - I might even be able
To suggest some nice restaurants! For cars, I think that is best arranged
From london when the flight is booked. By the way, you will all need a full
Uk drivers licence to hire the car and a passport with more than a six (?)
Months to go before expiry.
Shirley - would it be best to use the usual 3 coupons on the guest car park
Ticket method for parking?
Regards,
Anjam
