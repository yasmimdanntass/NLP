Subject: parking at 777 clay
HI louis:
We will have several employees from the london office coming to houston
This summer (they will be rotating) beginning 7/31/00. Can we get a parking
Space at 777 clay for them? We only need one for 7/31/00 - 11/30/00 (4
Months).
The other alternative would be the stickers for allen center. Do you still
Have
Them?
Please let me know.
Thanks!
Shirley crenshaw
