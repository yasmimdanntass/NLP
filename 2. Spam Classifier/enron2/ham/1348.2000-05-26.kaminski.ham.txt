Goodmorning vince,
This is a very much needed fax machine.
Mike gave approval for the new fax machine, also I spoke with shirley
Concerning this matter.
We have some new clients that requires faxes with long distance locations
And the new fax machine will ensure that it reaches them in record time.
Thanks

Kevin,
Per your request, please see below:
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
New facsimile machine information
Please take a look@ the following and let me know, which fax machine you
Choose or if you need information on something smaller, then I will have the
Vendor contact you directly to finalise installation. An enron director or
Above {with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract} will
Have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
Installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
Either vendor listed below will be able to provide a" loaner" should you have
A business need. Please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
When ordering the equipment.
If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a notes - mail
To the move team {erica@ x 3 - 3185 or janelle@ x 5 - 7917} requesting the
Installation of a new fax line. The move team can be found in the notes - mail
" ect address book".
If you are an ees employee, you must first get new equipment approval from
Ees budget control. Contact susan mcleroy@ x 5 - 8066 or via notes - mail.
If you are an ebs employee, you must first get new equipment approval from
Ebs purchasing & budget control. Contact paula corey@ x 3 - 9948 or martha
Reyna@ x 3 - 3491. You can reach both of these people via notes - mail.
If you are an ena employee, you must first get new equipment approval from
Ena finance & budget control. Contact lorie belsha@ x 3 - 9617 or via
Notes - mail.
A note on the fax machines listed below:
All the machines listed below come with a 2 nd paper tray and upgraded memory
{maxed by model ~see below} as an enron standard from each vendor.
All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated@ 33. 6 kbps versus
The canon laserclass 7500 {example only}@ 14. 4 kbps = new fax machine should
Be noticeably quicker.
Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the
Canon laserclass 7500 {example only}
Maintenance = models listed below have maintenance/repair coverage included
In monthly $total. There is no separate agreement! Toner/drum cartridges +
Paper + line charges are extra {not quoted}
Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know asap if a
Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
Models.
If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some
Considerations:
No more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look@ the fax machine
Placement on eb 30 or eb 31.
Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33. 6 k modem and jbig
Compression {or equivalent}.
Look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {models
Quoted are loaded}.
Maintenance is to be included in monthly cost {models quoted are covered}.

The above machines are designed for workgroup use.
Q) how many people will be using this fax machine?
Q) how much usage will this fax machine have?
{i. E. Heavy = 40 faxes per day@ 20 pages/60 faxes per day@ 2 - 3 pages or a
Lot less? If" heavy", either the pb 2050, pb 9930 or uf 885/uf 895 should fit
Your needs = if 15 - 40, the pb 9830 would probably be a better fit}

Processing or payment of facsimile {fax} machine invoices.
In order to return any old fax machine equipment, you must contact the
Leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter
That terminates the agreement. If you terminate a contract within the
Original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of
Fax machines are on a non - cancellable lease agreement. The vendor who
Supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $
Amounts for your existing equipment.
If you are asked to pay outstanding $amounts, be aware that some vendors
Include the cost of outright purchase of the old fax equipment = from the
Contracts I have reviewed so far, you are under no obligation to purchase the
Old equipment.
