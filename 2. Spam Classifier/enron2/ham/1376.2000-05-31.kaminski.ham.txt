Here are several items that you need to know about.
1. Paul johnson said that monday night would be fine for the dinner with
Spyros.
2. Lucy deathridge from risk called and needed your presentation for the
Boston conference by this evening in order to have copies made. I told
Her
You were in meetings and had been very busy, I did not know whether your
Presentation was ready or not. We can have 500 copies made from the
Copy center and overnight them to her next week, but you won' t be here on
The 9 th to do this. Do you have any suggestions?
