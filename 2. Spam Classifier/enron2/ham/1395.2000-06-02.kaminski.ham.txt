HI vince,
?
Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are making their way up to
Houston to visit with you and grant.
?
I was reading the promotional material for the eprm conference here in july.
I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the evening between the
Main conference and the post - conference seminars (18 th july). We have a
Pretty spectacular view of the harbour here that you might enjoy.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
