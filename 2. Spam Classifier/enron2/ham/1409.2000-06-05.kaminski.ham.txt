Subject: re: ff vols from historical fwd price curves
Winston,
I am sending you ffd vol curves which are calculated based on 1 month (18
Log - returns)
Of data with 0. 97 decay factor. These vols give $3. 14 m in var for
Storage - prc (versus 3. 37 in production
For 5/30/00).
Tell me what I need to change in the format so that it is convenient for you.
Tanya
