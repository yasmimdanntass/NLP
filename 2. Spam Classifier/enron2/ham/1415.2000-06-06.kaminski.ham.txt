Vince - thanks for the update. I' ve been pulled into a 7: 00 am breakfast
Which I must attend. Chances are I could catch up with everyone between
8: 00 and 8: 15. I apologize, but two of my breakfast dates are taking
Special flights in just for the breakfast - or I wouldn' t inconvenience
Everyone.
