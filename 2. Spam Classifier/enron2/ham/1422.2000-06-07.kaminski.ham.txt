Subject: resume of phil roan, koch weather desk
Shirley,
Phil roan, the quantitative analyst from koch' s weather derivatives group
Will be here on the afternoon of friday june 16, beginning say, at 1: 30 or
2: 00. Vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together (as i
Understand, vince himself will be unavailable that day).
Mark tawney should see him; someone from weather marketing and/or
Structuring should see him, e. G. Gary taylor and/or michael nguyen; some more
People from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues,
E. G. Vasant and/or zimin as well as mike roberts or someone on his team. Phil
Has only been a" quant" since the departure of koch' s previous weather quant
In february; before that he was koch' s weather" risk manager". I am still not
Sure what the distinction means, but we do need to find out how much he knows
About option pricing and meteorology. Even though his expressed desire is to
Focus on weather derivatives, we should also assess how useful he would be
From research group' s perspective, since research will likely be his official
Home.
Finally, jere overdyke and/or someone else from his group (george carrick,
If available) should also get a chance to meet with him. I' ve already spoken
With phil, but i' d like to sit in with either vasant or zimin or mike when
They interview him, since I wasn' t able to ask any technical questions.
If i' m counting correctly, that should amount to five interview sessions,
Perhaps less if we interview in groups of two. Phil' s resume is enclosed
Below.
Joe
P. S. I will also forward this to jason sokolov. He will let you know if any
People from rac would also like to meet with him.
