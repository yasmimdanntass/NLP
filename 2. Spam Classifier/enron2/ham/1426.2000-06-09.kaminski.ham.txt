Subject: ftr team,
The copy of the auction results that you got at yesterday' s meeting is
Incorrect. What happened was when I tried to sort the entire page, I only
Highlighted the related column and expected excel 98 would sort the whole
Page. (as steve told me before, I should highlight the whole thing if I try
To do sorting in excel). I appolized for the misleading and have redone the
Whole thing. Thanks for the patience. Wish you all have a great weekend.
