HI vanessa:
You will need to fill out a" churn request" and forward it to the" move team"
They will take care of everything that you put on the form. I am attaching a
Copy
Of the form for your information. The receiving department is responsible
For
Doing this. He will need boxes to pack his belongings (ask him how many
He needs - he will have to do the packing). The only item that moves other
Than his personal items, is his telephone. The computer, chair, etc.
Belongs to
The research group.
If you have any questions, or need help, please let me know.
Thanks!
