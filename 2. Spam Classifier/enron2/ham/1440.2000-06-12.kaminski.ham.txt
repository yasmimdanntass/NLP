Good morning,
I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron. Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
Experience. I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.
I mentioned a couple web sites and don' t know if they came through clearly on
The phone with my sore throat.
The neural network approach to timing can be found at

The introductory piece on technical analysis I wrote for forbes. Com and the
Glossary can be found at htttp:// www. Forbes. Com/tool/html/00/jun/0603/feat. Htm
I am also working with long time friend and neighbor steve nison with his
Site and you can see the first on line lesson for free at
