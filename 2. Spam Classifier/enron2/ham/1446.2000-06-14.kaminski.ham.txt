Subject: re: seneca lake storage
Deirdre,
I run two senarios using two different curves.
I got $1. 39/mmbtu per year for if - cng/north, and
$1. 41/mmbtu per year for if - cng/n _ cityga.
Therefore if we look at 20 years time horizon, the storage
Can generate $1. 40 * 1. 4 * 20 = 39. 2 mm dollars.
Let us discuss if you have any questions.
