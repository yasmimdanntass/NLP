Subject: followup from iris mack
Hi,
Thank you for your email. I am indeed interested in exploring
Opportunities in your group - research (quantitative modeling).
Just a note to let you know that I am not in the pure quantitative
Research
Group here at bnp paribas - but in the derivatives structured products. I do
Some of my own modeling and basic excel programming. I used to do a lot of
Fortran programming. However, I am not a very good c/c + + programmer.
Hope this gives you further details about my skills and interests.
Thank you,
Iris
In
Iris,
At this point it' s my group: research, i. E. Quantitative modeling.
Please, let me know what your interests are and I shall try to line up
Other groups for the interview.

Dear dr. Kaminski,
How are you? It was nice to meet you at the real options conference
In
Nyc.
I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk. In
Particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options. This
Is
Something I am interested in as well.
When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
Detail?
Thanks for your time and consideration. Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Iris mack
