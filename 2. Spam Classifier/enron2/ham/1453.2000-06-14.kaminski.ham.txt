Subject: vince,
This morning I got a call from richard bryant, director of computational
Finance
Program at carnegie mellon university (the program kevin and I went through).
He' s interested in getting enron involved with their program designing and
(more critically I guess) campus recruiting effort. I gave him your phone
Number
And email. You can expect to hear something from him soon.
Best,
Alex
