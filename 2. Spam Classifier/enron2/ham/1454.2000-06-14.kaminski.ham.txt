Subject: security question
Dear guys
Having been out of the office for a couple of days, i' ve found myself the
Victim of theft (again). This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from
Its" hiding place" under my telephone. I * always * lock my drawers and keep
The key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the
Drawers unlocked, and the key missing. Although there' s nothing sensitive on
Or around my desk, i' m concerned about the security implications of someone
Sniffing around the office in this manner. I also found the papers on my
Desk extensively reshuffled last week.
Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen
From among the many and varied books on my desk. That couldn' t have been a
Random theft, and I fear this isn' t either. I can' t understand who' d be so
Interested in a research guy' s belongings!
Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious
Activity around my desk?
Cheers,
Steve
