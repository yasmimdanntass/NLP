Shirley -
I spoke with janelle duree (manager - move team), she is investigating the
Mystery of the missing phone and will call me back with status - if you can
Take care of the pc, I think we look good on the phone. I also spoke with
Paul racicot to make sure we are all of the same mind and he is set as well.

Subject: move computer from the research group 19 th floor to the 44 th floor
HI emmanuel:
We need a computer installed on the 44 th floor tomorrow, if at all possible.
We have a new summer intern coming on monday the 19 th and the
Computer and everything else has disappeared from his desk.
The location is eb 4444 b.
The computer we are moving is clayton vernon' s old computer. He is
Finishing up moving his files to his new computer as I am writing this.
Please call me in the morning and we will talk further.
Thanks!
Shirley crenshaw
