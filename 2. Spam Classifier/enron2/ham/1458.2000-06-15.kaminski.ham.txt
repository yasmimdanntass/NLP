Subject: intranet site
Dear dale/all,
Thanks for the interest... I have already contacted intranet development
About updates - they don' t have to do much except publish the document and
Maybe add some headings, so it resources are not really a problem. As you
Suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of
Well - explained introductions to various topics like value - at - risk, credit
Risk and so on. It should not be at too high a level and will probably have
To be written specifically for this purpose. If you have time to put any
Interesting material together (word docs, text files or power point
Presentations), please do pass it on to me and I will collate for the update.
Regards,
Anjam

Anjam,
This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site
And expand the coverage into new areas. Can you arrange some it resources
For us? If everyone in research works on developing the content, we just
Need it to publish it out to the intranet.
Thoughts??
