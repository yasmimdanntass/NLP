Anjam,
This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site
And expand the coverage into new areas. Can you arrange some it resources
For us? If everyone in research works on developing the content, we just
Need it to publish it out to the intranet.
Thoughts??

HI sven,
Thanks a lot for your note - I think it would be great to see what we can do
To help you & joe' s business units. Plenty of our knowledge is no longer
Proprietary in that quite a lot of this information is now in the public
Domain - we can sit down and discuss this on thursday afternoon if that works
For you.
Regards,
Anjam

Anjam, congratulations on your initiative. I appreciate that you share this
Information throughout enron.
As you may know, my group is working with joe' s business units to create
So - called market hubs.
I see great potential in sharing some of the information that you have
Acucmulated and that is not proprietary to enron.
I would appreciate if we could sit down tomorrow and talk about the
Possibility to leverage on the existing know - how.
Regards
Sven
