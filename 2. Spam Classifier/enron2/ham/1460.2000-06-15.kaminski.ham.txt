Following the recent lunch presentations, there has been considerable
Interest from enron europe staff in improving their quantitative skills,
Helping to maintain our competitive advantage over competitors. We have

Introduction to the group and also information on:
Derivatives pricing

Extensive links database
If you have any questions or issues on quantitative analysis (including
Hedging and risk management of derivatives) please don' t hesitate to get in
Touch.
