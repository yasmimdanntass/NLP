Subject: pac enrollment
Last year the enron political action committee (pac) launched a campaign to
Become a" million dollar pac". Enron employees, who provide all of the
Funding for the pac, responded and the enron pac reached its objective,
Becoming one of the largest corporate pacs. This year we face a new
Challenge. With the sale of eog, the announced sale of pge and normal
Employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent
Contributors. We are seeking your support. If you are not a member, please
Join. If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your
Contribution.
The enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
Policy. Our pac funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both
Parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice. Amounts
Contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
Federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal
Election campaign act. While our pac has grown thanks to our employee
Contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
Those who oppose these ideals.
This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
Our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of
E - commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,
International trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and
State decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
A variety of environmental and tax issues. Enron has a long and successful
Track record of supporting and advancing good public policy. That track
Record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers.
The pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
About what they are doing.
One of the best things about enron is that we don , t just take things as they
Are. We challenge the status quo. We ask why. We change things. The pac
Helps us do that. We need you to help the pac. Sign up today - and please
