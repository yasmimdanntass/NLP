Subject: today' s discussion
Anjam, thanks for organising this - and vince thanks for making yourself
Available for the discussion.
I am working for joe gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an
Additional sales and communication channel for our european business units.
Through the web we are also able to convey a more local image, rather than
Presenting ourselves as a texan company through enron. Com.
To set you into perspective about what we have in mind I have attached a
Brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project.
We intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons:
Document our know - how base
Educate the market participants
Generate great stickiness (participants should know that if they need to know
S. Th. On energy risk mgt. They should go to enron)
Later on: have the option to commercialise this area.
I look forward to our discussion.
Kind regards
Sven becker
