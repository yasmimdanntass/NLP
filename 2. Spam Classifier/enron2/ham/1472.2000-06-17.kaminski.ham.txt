Subject: re: opportunities at enron
Vince kaminski,
I am one of the stanford students that you interviewed last october.
I really apologize for contacting you that late, but for
Some reason when I wrote the email that I transcribe below I did not send
It, and just realized about that until now.
Also, I want to thank you again for opening the
Possibility of a summer internship at enron.
Regards,
Jorge picazo
