Subject: re: real options
HI navroz
Having presented my real options work at a recent conference, I think I can
See my way clear to producing a much reduced version (3 or 4 pages) of my
" diagrammatic real options" paper. Would risk still be interested in such a
Shortened article?
Cheers,

Steven,
After further consultation with the technical editor, we feel that your work
Would find a more suitable environment for exposure in the journal of risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the editor - in - chief, philippe jorion)
And outline what has happened to:
?
? Pjorion@ uci. Edu
?
Then I am sure that they will be keen to give due consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming to this
Decision.
?
Best wishes,
?
Navroz patel,
Technical assistant, risk magazine.
