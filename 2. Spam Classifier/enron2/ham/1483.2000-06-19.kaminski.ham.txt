Subject: initial collection of research material for your web sites
Dear sven the packets cover electricity and gas markets and modelling,
Deregulation & exchanges, weather derivatives and value - at - risk/risk
Management/case studies. This is by no means final, and I hope to supplement
With some more ideas over the next few days. Once you have considered the
Material, I can fine - tune the type of material that is relevant for you and
Then we can look at starting to put something together, after which we can
Pass on to mike roberts
If you need some simple articles on pricing options or an explanation on how
To calculate volatility, then I am sure we can put that together for you.
Regards,
Anjam
