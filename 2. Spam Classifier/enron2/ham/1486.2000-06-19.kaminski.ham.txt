Subject: additional resources
Ben and I have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated
Support from houston on our project. We are wondering what the possibility
Is of having either amitava or vasant come over for 8 - 12 weeks to help get
Things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as
Provide some guidance on the clo part of the business and potentially hiring
An additional full time resource. If there is any possibility, it would be
Hugely valuable given the long lead times to get someone from the city in and
Integrated in addition to the significant cost.
Let me know your thoughts
