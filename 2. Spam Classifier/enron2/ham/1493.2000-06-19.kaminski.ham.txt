Subject: re: prospective 6/22 houston visit
Professor ronn:
Thank you for your email and I wish to respond as follows:
I have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a
Hotel reservation closer into town. I will let you know.
I have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen
Installed. However, there is really not room for a lectern. The overhead
Will
Sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part
Of the table for their presentation copies.
I will be glad to make copies for you, however, it would be a big help if you
Could email me a copy of your presentation on wednesday. Thursday
Mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have
Time to make the copies.
I hope this meets with your approval. Please let me know if you need
Anything else.
We look forward to your visit.
Regards,
Shirley crenshaw
