Janelle,
Fms records show that ext. 39189 was installed on 6/1 for mr. Paleologo,
There is no record to indicate the phone was ever puded.
I have requested to kathy brooks to re - install the phone. Kathy says that
She will reseach to find out why the phone was picked up and she will let me
Know.
Thanks
Linda
