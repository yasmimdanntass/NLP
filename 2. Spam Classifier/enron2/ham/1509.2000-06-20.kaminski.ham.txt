Subject: sabbatical
Dr. Kaminski:
?
I had intended to contact you regarding a position at enron this summer, but
The department really needed me to teach a section of undergraduate
Corporate finance this summer.? If all goes well, and? There is a place for
Me at enron, I would be able to start after the summer session ends in
Late? July.?
?
I? Discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at enron with drs. Tom arnold
And alex butler, both of whom send their regards, and they both felt the
Experience would be invaluable given my research and career objectives.? Dr.
Arnold and I agreed that a sabbatical of 1 - 2 years would be optimal.? I feel
That it would be difficult to get a good idea of where the company is
Headed, and to show how I can be a valuable team member in helping it get
There? In much less than a year.? He was afraid that the university would
Begin to grumble if I was gone for much more than 2 years.? Any suggestions?
?
Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you.
