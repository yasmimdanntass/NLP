I thank you once again for your invitation and look forward to my visit
This wed. My current schedule calls for a hobby arrival on wed. At 6: 23
P. M., in time for the dinner scheduled for that evening. (I can take a cab
Directly to the restaurant if you' re scheduling a circa 6: 45 - 7 p. M.
Dinner.) further, I have tentatively set up the thur. Return flight to
Austin at 3: 38 p. M., and that can be modified as desired.
> please, make a reservation at hyatt regency downtown or double tree
> downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).
When I made the room reservation last mon. 6/12, it turned out that these
Hotels showed no vacancy (is there a conference in town?), so the nearest i
Could obtain is the hilton houston plaza (6633 travis) some 3. 5 miles away
From enron. (if it is important that I stay at the closer hotels, shirley
Might ascertain whether enron' s travel agent can obtain a room there.)
I take this opportunity to request of shirley that, subject to your
Approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available
For the room where the 11: 30 luncheon meeting takes place. Also, since i
Would like each participant to have his/her own copy, I would ask her to
Advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend, or
Alternatively, shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when i
Bring the" master" copy in thur. Morn.
I look forward to seeing you wed. And thur. Best regards,
Ehud
