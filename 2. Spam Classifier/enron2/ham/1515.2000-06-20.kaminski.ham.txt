Subject: re: backtesting for different percentiles
Vlady, I enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots (you saw them before).
The following table shows what was the percentage of the days when pnl fell
Below var 95, var 90, var 85.
These results are based on the real ng forward prices from 1/1/99 to 6/7/00
For 2 different portfolios:
- portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to ng - price - prc portfolio
Positions on 6/6/00,
- portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to storage - prc positions on
5/25/00.
Portfolio 1
Var 95 var 90 var 85
Implied vols 2. 93 4. 11 5. 57
Historical vols with decay = 1 7. 62 12. 02 15. 54
Historical vols withdecay = 0. 97 6. 75 12. 02 15. 54
Historical vols withdecay = 0. 94 6. 45 12. 02 15. 54
Portfolio 2
Var 95 var 90 var 85
Implied vols 4. 1 6. 74 9. 97
Historical vols with decay = 1 7. 04 11. 14 15. 84
Historical vols withdecay = 0. 97 6. 74 10. 56 16. 13
Historical vols withdecay = 0. 94 7. 04 11. 14 15. 84
This shows that when we have more observations (columns corresponding to
Var 90 and var 85)
Compared to the column corresponding to var 95 the frequency of curve shift
Being lower than var
Becomes closer to the theoretical value (5%, 10% and 15%). The numbers in the
Column" var 85" are
Very close to 15%. This is the argument in favor of using historical vols.
And also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment.
Also notice: the numbers in column" var 95" are higher than 5% and this is an
Indication of fat tails.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Tanya.
