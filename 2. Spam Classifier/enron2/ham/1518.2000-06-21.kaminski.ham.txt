Passwords
The key to maintaining information and systems security is the use of
Well - selected and guarded passwords. Please remember, your password is our
First line of defense. It is important that:
? Your password should be unique and only known to you.
? Your password should never be shared with someone else.
? A password must never be written down (i. E. Post - it notes), stored in files
On personal computers, at workstations, hidden under keyboards, configured on
Terminal hot - keys, etc.
? Passwords must be changed every 60 days.
Strong password selection criteria will soon be automated for all employees.
