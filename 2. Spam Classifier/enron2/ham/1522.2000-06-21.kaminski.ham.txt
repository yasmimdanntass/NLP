HI dorn & john, as you discovered recently, I am still' officially' in vince
Kaminski' s group (my original enron corp. Group). This holds true for shalesh
Ganjoo as well. I did not explicitly pick dorn or john as reviewers thinking
That they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting
Structure.
So, vince has agreed to' host' the review in his group and proceed to
Transfer me over to ebs officially when this quarter is overs (apprently that
Was scheduled to be automatic). In the mean time, vasant, stinson or vince
Would like to get a e - mail from either dorn or john regarding my performance
From their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.
I had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement
With my family already. Since I am not reviewing shalesh directly (since he
Is in research under stionson), I am assuming I don' t have to attend the
Review meetin tommorrow. I' ll be on the road starting in the morning. If i
Change this, I am told at home, that I will be in the market for another
Family! I can phone in if that is okay.
Kayla, could you page me with the details?
Regards,
Ravi.
