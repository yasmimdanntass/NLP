Subject: marketing for your espeak session
Vince:
Thanks for your time earlier this week; i' m looking forward to your espeak
Event.
Sarah and I met with our etv contact yesterday, and we will be able to put a
Bulleted list on the elevator screens to advertise your espeak. Please let
Me know what you would like us to post for you, and we will do the rest!
We also have plans to market specifically to the trader community here at
Enron, so you should get a high participation rate, especially from those
Groups.
Thanks, again.
