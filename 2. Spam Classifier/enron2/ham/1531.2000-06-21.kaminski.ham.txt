HI professor ronn:
I have ordered a flip chart and markers and an overhead projector.
There were 11 pages in your presentation and they look fine. We have
Already made the copies.
I believe everything is set - if you think of anything else, please let me
Know.
Enjoy your dinner tonight and we will see you tomorrow.
Regards,
Shirley crenshaw

There is one additional item I would request: if the room does not contain
A blackboard or whiteboard, I would appreciate a flip chart and markers.
I am faxing you my presentation handout for tomorrow. I would be grateful
If your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow' s 11: 30 a. M.
Meeting; vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30
Range. I will also bring along a" master copy" in case the trasmission
Unduly mangles the fax.
Thanks,
Ehud
