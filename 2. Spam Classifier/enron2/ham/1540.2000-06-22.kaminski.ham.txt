Thanks susan:
However, vince has not received his financial times at all this week. I have
Called everyday and they tell me they will send a recovery copy, but so far
We have not received one. Is there anyway we could get a copy for him
Today?
Your help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

Shirley,
Please find the below answers to the questions you had sent to judy.
Financial times - vince' s subscription does not exprire until january 4, 2001
Vince' s subscription to power finance & risk - what you recieved was not a
Renewal, it was for a free trial that began on june 5 th and ends on june 26.
Please disregard it. His subscription that we recently renewed does not
Expire until march 26, 2001.
I have sent in payment for vince' s renewal for oxford energy forum.
If there is anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to
Call me.
Susan
