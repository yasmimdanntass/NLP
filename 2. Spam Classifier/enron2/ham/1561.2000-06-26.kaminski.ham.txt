Subject: update - reimbursement of individually billed items
The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few
Years. As a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase
In the number of invoices and vendors. With the higher volume, we have
Reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.
Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual
Employees, they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable. At times
They fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone. In these
Cases we return the invoice to the vendor. If the employee is designated, we
Try to track him/her down and forward the invoice. The high level of
Employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this
Increasingly challenging. Either way, we end up doing something less
Productive than paying invoices.
To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary
For research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and
Other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay
For them by personal check or charge card (if applicable  * payment instructions
Are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through
Employee expense reports.
By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce
The amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of
Checks generated by treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and the
Turnaround time for payment of invoices.
Incidentally, accounts payable is currently installing a corporate - wide
Web - based expense reporting system similar to what enron international has
Used for the past year. This will make it even easier to file your expense
Report and receive quick reimbursement.
We , d like to make this effective immediately. If you have any questions or
Suggestions, please contact the accounts payable department.
