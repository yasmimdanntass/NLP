Subject: re: running credit model
Tanya,
Although i' m quite comfortable with providing support for running the model,
And assisting in providing the tools to enable easier analysis of the
Results, i' m not entirely comfortable with supporting a java debug
Environment within your team (including ad - hoc training), when we have
Facilities within the it development team to do it here.
I' d like to meet with you to discuss this, as this seems to be an ongoing
Issue, and would like to understand the ground rules by which your team
Operates in conjunction with it in general.
Regards
Steve

Subject: re: running credit model
Steve,
In order to be able to test the new credit model as well as to answer credit
Group' s
Questions regarding the outputs from this model research needs to be able to
Do the following:
1. Run credit model independently of the other runs. It is quite ok for now
To be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios.
2. Debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time.
Please, let me know if your team can help us.
Tanya.
