Grant,
Sorry for the silence. It' s definately not a commentary on your work - i' ve
Been travelling back and forward between sydney and london like a yo - yo and
Trying to tidy up things on our end. I' ve been working on incoporating your
Material and will spend all of tomorrow on this (hopefully!) so that I can
Ask for the last few amendments before the w/end.
Many thanks and best regards.
Chris.
