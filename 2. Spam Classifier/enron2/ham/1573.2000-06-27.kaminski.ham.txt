Subject: impending visit
Vince:
I sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
At your offices on july 5 or july 7 in houston to follow up our earlier
Discussions. I notice I have two email addresses for you, so I am sending
This to both. I am not sure the earlier transmission got to you.
Would you be available the afternoon of the 5 th or the morning of the 7 th to
Continue our earlier discussions? Give me an email or phone shout at
650. 218. 3069.
Thanks
