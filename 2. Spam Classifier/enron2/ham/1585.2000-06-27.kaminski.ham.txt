Jana,
A correction. I am going to spend one week in australia and I have
Just realized that I have to leave on friday, july the 14 th, at night,
To arrive in sydney on sunday morning.
Maybe we can meet on friday the 7 th (we would like to invite you
To dinner and then we can have a glass of wine outside, the weather
And mosquitoes permitting).
Alternatively, we can meet during the weekend of july the 29 th.

Vince,
The weekend of july 15, 2000 is fine for us. Which day is better for
You - - friday or saturday?
Do you want to go to the woodlands for a show, or just visit? Also, let me
Know if I can bring something.
Thanks and we look forward to meeting your family.
Jana
