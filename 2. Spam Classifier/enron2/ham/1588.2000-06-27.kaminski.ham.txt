Subject: re: interview with enron corp.
Dear ms. Crenshaw:
I recently accepted a quant position with texaco in houston. Lara berry
From enron contacted me just after that, and I told her of the situation.
I agreed to send her my resume (which I did) and keep in touch.
Enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities. Mr. Kaminski
Is very well known in the energy field, and I have read some of his
Material. I am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me;
However, I have given my word to texaco.
The texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk. This is the kind
Of challenge for which I am looking. If things do not work out, however, i
Would definitely contact enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
Interview.
Thank you very much,
Cliff parsons
