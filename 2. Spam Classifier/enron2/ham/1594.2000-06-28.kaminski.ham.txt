Subject: re: chapter 3
Gentlemen,
Thankyou for your fine effort. I' ll e - mail thru thurs eve (sydney time) what
We have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn' t toooo
Painful) to see if it is ok with you. A couple of quick questions though.
Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
Footnotes - can you please resend them?
Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
You plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
With different axis?
Many thanks and best regards.
Chris.
