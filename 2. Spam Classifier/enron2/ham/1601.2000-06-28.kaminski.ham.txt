Subject: yesterday' s power outage
As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage wednesday morning in the
Enron building. This outage was caused by localized structural failure of
The raised floor in our 34 th floor data center. This resulted in disruption
To the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of
Ena servers.
As a cautionary move, enron online was interrupted while the extent of the
Failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11: 23 to
11: 39. All enron building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for
Approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ena trading systems were
Unavailable for over two hours. During this time the power was stabilized
And systems were restored. Immediate steps are being taken to correct this
Problem.
We apologize for this inconvenience.
