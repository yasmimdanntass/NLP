Subject: 6/30 aga forecast at 66
Mike,
My number for next week is 66 (from seasonal holt - winter model, shw).
I am also fitting aga to an arimax model. As discussed, I need weighted
Temperature
Data for east, west and production areas. I would appreciate if you could
Provide that data.
After that, I could add forward price curve as explainatory variables.
Since aga is a market mover, it is important to have an accurate model.
