Subject: re: portcalc methodology
Keith,
Both power and emrs use a c library provided (also implemented) by research
Group. The methodology of greek calculations in power portcalc has not
Changed for more than 6 years since I joined enron 6 years ago. Vince
Kaminski, stinson gibner or grant masson should be able to help you with both
Questions.

I' ve been asked by risk management:
A) who in research originally signed off the portcalc formulae
B) for a copy of the documentation of the methodology (greek calculations,
Etc.)
Hope you can help on both counts.
Thanks
Keith
