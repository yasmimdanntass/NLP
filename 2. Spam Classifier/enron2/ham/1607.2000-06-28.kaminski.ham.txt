HI tanya
Thanks for your time last week - i' ve been travelling a bit but i' m now back
In london at mg to commence obtaining information for you.
I' m not really sure where to start on this, so initially I propose to get:
A complete data set (i. E. All live trades from all entities) which includes
Prices and volatilities
A separate file of options
Any written valuation methodologies used by the core systems
There is a project to obtain a data feed from an mg system called mercur.
This is their risk management system but we are proposing to use it along the
Lines of a data warehouse, not a risk system. I' d be happy to talk you
Through any other current issues.
Let me know if there' s anything else you need at present.
Regards
