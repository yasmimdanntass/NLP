Subject: loan recommendation form
Hi, vince,
I was told by molly that she hasn' t received the recommendation form from you
Yet.
Since I got admission late from the school, now I am short of time of getting
I - 20 which needs loan approval,
And getting visa status transferred (from h - 1 to f - 1) which requires I - 20 and
Loan approval
And normally takes around 45 days through ins (immigration naturalization
Service).
Now, I am trying to push every step to speed up the process in order to
Catch up the school opening at beginning of sept.
I know I just told you this late last week. Nevertheless, I am writing to see
If you can squeeze some time to finish the recommendation form anytime soon.
It will be a big help.
Thank you very much, vince.
Have a good day.
Sincerely,
LI x 39635
