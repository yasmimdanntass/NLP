Hey you guys,
We are trying to implement a' var transaction' policy - and would like your
Opinion.
This is going to be tough - because i' m not sure we have implemented a
Similiar policy across any of our other' books' - that is - we looking to
Bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the mtm stuff
(lambdas). To have a real - live' configuration' of the system.
If assets/routes/servers etc... Are added - what is the impact on the' value'
Of the system and what it' s worth.
John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.
I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know
The var of your whole trading portfolio. However - i' ve not seen this done
With a mixture of mtm & accrual assets. Add the spice of a' operational
System' valuation - and this will be tough to quantify and model.
Step 1 - configure system and value it
Step 2 - calculate a var on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental var of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc
- tough....
See what you think?

Here is a first rough draft of a" value@ risk" transaction policy.
I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get
Some early thinking going on limits for the v@ r. For example, should we
Effectively shut down all server relocations without approval, or allow some
Level of mb of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?
I need some commercial and industry realism for this. We may need rick
Paiste or your industry helpers (marquardt, etc. To help us).
Barry, lou, I need your input.
