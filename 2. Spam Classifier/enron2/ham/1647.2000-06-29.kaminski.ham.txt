Subject: component var
Tanya,
Some stability tests were performed on the simulation.
(1) the window size of the averaging in the simulation was changed from 10 to
20 for ng - price (the biggest book in gas) for effective date june - 28. As you
Can see in the file 28 ng - price _ windowsize, the component var numbers are very
Similar.
(2) to look at a calculational comparison, I looked at the storage - prc book
(which has no gamma position) for effective date of 27 th and (a) calculated
Ffvols, and (b) calculated the riskmetrics var (the correlations are very high
Across the term structure) and compared to the component var code
Calculation, and again the two nubers are comparable, given the different
Modes of calculation.
