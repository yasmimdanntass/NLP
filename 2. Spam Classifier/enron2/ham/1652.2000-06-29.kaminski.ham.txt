Rates are a little higher in august than they are in april (august is high
Season for summer), but I can do those rooms at $125 (your april rate was
$105).
What kind of meeting space will you need? If you can get me a tentative
Agenda, I will get the contract drawn up right away.
Thanks again!
Steve

Hello again!
I promise I am not running! The deal that we worked out with the general
Manager (tom pratt) is that enron has a $6000 credit with the great divide
Lodge that will expire on 8/1/00. You can either use that credit for
Individual rooms prior to 8/1/00, or we have agreed that we can apply that
Amount to a meeting prior to the thanksgiving holiday in 2000 if the
Contract is signed before 8/1/00.
At this point, august 18 - 20 is available, but the 25 - 28 is not. If we can
Get this signed prior to 7/31/00, your $6000 credit would be able to be
Applied to this event.
Please let me know if this will work for you. Thanks!
Steve

Hello steve:
Please don' t run! I know after the last fiasco with an enron offsite you
Are
Probably running for the hills!
I do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even
Though we were unable to make the trip.
However, I understand there has been an arrangement made with enron,
That if we book a time and come before thanksgiving we can recoup the money
That we forfeited? Please let me know if I am understanding this
Correctly.
If so, we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite.
We are looking at the weekends of august 18, 19 and 20 or august 25,
26 and 27 th. There will be approximately 12 people.
Please let me know your understanding of the arrangement and the
Availability of the dates mentioned.
Look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
