Subject: mg metals: additional areas to look at
Dear lloyd & richard,
I have been discussing with eric gadd about two particular areas of concern
That will affect the london research group. I believe there are a number of
Issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk
Management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a
(by no means exhaustive) list: -
I) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic
Options linking perspective (e. G. Their spreadsheets link to different option
Pricing add - ins)
Ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we
Can capture metals risk in our var system (we will require historical data
For this). I am sure bjorn will be looking to the research group to assist
In this matter.
Iii) ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our
Methods and systems and vice versa
These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross - communication with
Relevant contacts within mg metals, and so I look forward to starting on the
Process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative
Research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes
Smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to
Involve me.
Best regards,
Anjam ahmad
