Subject: sap expense report form
With the implementation of sap, the employee expense report form has been
Modified to reflect the new coding system. The procedures for its use are
Unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences. One item to note: the
Form no longer requires entry of your social security number; instead use
Your new personnel number assigned through human resources (see
Http:// hrweb. Enron. Com). For electronically submitted expense reports, enter
The same number on the receipt envelope.
The form is now available at the sap website. To access the form:
From the enron home page, go to the sap intranet site http:// sap. Enron. Com
Choose one of the following paths:
Click on quick reference tools on the left menu
Click drop - down arrow for accounts payable forms
Click sap expense report form
Click on forms and procedures library on the left menu
Click drop - down arrow for accounts payable forms
Click sap expense report form
Wait for it to load
Click enable macros (or yes, allow macros)
After you enter the data, save as excel workbook (. Xls file extension) with a
New filename. Do not save as excel template (. Xlt extension).
You may print the spreadsheet for submission to accounts payable, or attach
It to notes for electronic submission. Instructions are available at the
Website, on the same drop down box as the form.
