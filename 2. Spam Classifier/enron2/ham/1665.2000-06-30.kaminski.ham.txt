Dr. Kaminski:
?
I just wanted to touch base and see if I needed to snail mail a copy of my
Resume or get in touch with anyone else over at enron.?
?
The finance department at lsu will be sending out financial award letters to
New ph. D. Students before long, and my interning at enron would free up some
Additional departmental funds.? In addition, if I will be here in baton
Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.? I am able
To pursue an internship in large part because of the department' s
Cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and
Or teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of ph. D.? I have been
Told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at lsu, so I am trying to
Rock the boat as little as possible.
?
I realize until I receive an offer from enron my internship (I say
Internship rather than sabbatical because lsu will not continue to pay me my
Stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by
Enron.? I understand that there are procedures? And protocols that must be
Followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is
Necessary to move to the next step in that process.
?
I will be in houston on july 8 & 9 for my wife' s grandmother' s 80 th
Birthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in town? On the preceding
Friday, or following monday for a visit and/or interview.? If not, given the
Relatively close proximity between baton rouge and houston, I would be happy
To come at another time.
?
Thanks again,
Shane green
