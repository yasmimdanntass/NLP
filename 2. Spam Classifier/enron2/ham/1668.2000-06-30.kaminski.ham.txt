Shijie:
I spoke with vince and he said friday the 28 th of july would be fine for
Your visit to enron.
Please let me know your itinerary when you have it confirmed. There
Are two hotels downtown houston, the doubletree and the hyatt regency
That are very close to the enron bldg.
If you need help with anything, please let me know.
Look forward to having you at enron.
Regards,
Shirley crenshaw
