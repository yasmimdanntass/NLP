HI richard,
Lloyd fleming introduced me to the key personnel on the trading and risk side
At mg today; I spent most of today discussing forward curves and option
Volatilities with tim jones, russell plackett and jon barrett. I hope to be
Able to get historical data from david thompson to facilitate forward curve
Analysis for our var models. Also discussed valuation issues (e. G. Option on
Calendar spread that they need a model for). Also was able to get a good
Understanding of trading strategies and nuances of aluminum, copper and
Nickel markets.
Regards,
Anjam
