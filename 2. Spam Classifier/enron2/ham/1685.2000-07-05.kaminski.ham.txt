Dale,
Friday is a bad day (performance review committee all day).
What about 7: 00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7: 00? We can meet
At hyatt regency downtown (smith street).

Vince:
Can we get together friday morning july 7 at 800 am at your office? That
Would be particularly convenient for me. I will have to leave downtown at
About 945 to catch a plane. That will ensure that I wont take up too much
Of your time!! Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient
With me.
