Subject: interesting article about enron in japan' s electricity newspaper
Japan' s electricity newspaper (" denkI shimbun", the equivalent of megawatt
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century. Several
Of these have focused on the power industry in the u. S. A friend of mine ran
Across one on enron that was published on april 13 and sent it to me. I
Thought you would find it interesting.
The article focuses on ees in particular and about how we try to succeed by
Being first to meet our clients' changing needs. It also describes how we
Use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.
The article also briefly mentions the new office in japan.
The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is
About enron. Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the japanese
Are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.
DenkI shimbun also has a web site at" www. Shimbun. Denki. Or. Jp". They have
Small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is
Completely in japanese). Another interesting site is
" www. Criepi. Denken. Or. Jp", the english home site of japan' s central research
Institute of electric power industry (denryoku chuo kenkyuujou). The site
Has many links to other english - language sites related to the power industry
In japan.
