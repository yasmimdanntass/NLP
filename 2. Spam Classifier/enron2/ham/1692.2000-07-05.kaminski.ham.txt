Can you guys followup with him to coordinate an enron reception following a
Presentation that vince kaminiskI will give during their annual ut
Foundations of energy finance class. We do want to do this, and of course
Need to coordinate with vince and your dates on campus to ensure that we have
No conflicts.
I am not sure if this falls into the associate or analyst camp. You can best
Determine who the appropriate contact should be. Leave me an e - mail to
Confirm.

Celeste,
Greetings.
As you may recall, I am the director of the univ. Of texas center for
Energy finance (cefer). I would like at this time to initiate planning for
Your colleague vince kaminski' s annual presentation to the ut foundations
Of energy finance class which I will be presenting as usual the first half
Of the fall semester.
Thus, to begin, I wonder whether either the above is your current e - mail
Account, and, with the departure of meryl barnett (with whom I believe we
Coordinated this in the past), whether this is an issue within your scope.
With respect to this reception, I appreciate that there may be other enron
Receptions scheduled for this fall. However, if you so choose, I would
Like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an enron reception
Following vince' s presentation. If you would indeed like to do so, i
Suggest we coordinate with vince the date for the presentation/reception.
Sincerely,
Ehud
