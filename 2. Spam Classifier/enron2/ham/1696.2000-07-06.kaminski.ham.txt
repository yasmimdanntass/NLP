Hello,
I am on the qa team for the win 2 k roll - out. We need your help in testing
" alcar" in a windows 2000 environment.
This testing is crucial to the success of converting all pc' s from nt 4 to
Windows 2000. We ask that you make an appointment to come to our offices
(eb 2224 b) to preform the test. It should not take more than 15 minutes.
Please e - mail me as soon as possible.
Thanks,
Brenda cassel
