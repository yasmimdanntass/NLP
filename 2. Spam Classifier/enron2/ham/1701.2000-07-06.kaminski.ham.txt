Teresa,
I would like to invite iris for an interview in houston.
She works currently in london can you call her
And ask when she is planning to visit the states.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the states.
I would hate to pay the lst class ticket from london to houston,
Though I would go for it, if necessary (I don' t
Want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard
For business related, cross - atlantic flights.
I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.
Thanks
Vince

Dear dr. Kaminski,
How are you? It was nice to meet you at the real options conference
In
Nyc.
I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk. In
Particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options. This
Is
Something I am interested in as well.
When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
Detail?
Thanks for your time and consideration. Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Iris mack
