Subject: re: oracle tables which contain the position and curves information
For enron' s var system
Andreas,
As we discussed today, I am sending you some information on how the positions
And curves
Are stored in our database. In the enclosed file you' ll find the list of
Columns for 4 tables and
2 quarries as an example. 3 of these tables contain the positions
Information, 1 table has the curves information.
Ramesh (who supports our var model from it side) will send you the
Description of these tables.
Regards,
Tanya.
