Subject: re: price processes for ng
Grant & vince,
I am sending you the results of fitting different price process models into ng
Prompt month prices. The fit is quite good for some models.
We might think of using these mean - reverting jump - diffusion models in our
Credit model.
I should examine other contracts behavior (beyond prompt month) as well.
Tanya.
