Subject: re:
Lloyd,
I think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead.
I don' t see a justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we
Have an alternative solution.

I met maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within
Enron. I think it would be very helpful to promote the research group
Function of the company, particularly given maureen' s background, if she
Could be introduced to some of the main traders down at mg. Unfortunately
She won' t have time to meet with mg unless we can schedule some meetings on
Monday.
Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till monday to allow the
Meetings to take place?
Regards
