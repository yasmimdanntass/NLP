Subject: new expense account forms
Hello all:
Along with the inception of the new sap time keeping, we also have new
Expense account forms.
They will no longer use your social security number as the id on your
Expense accounts, they want you to use your new employee #that was
Sent to you by email to access hronline.
In order for anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports, we
Will need your new employee #.
Please send this number to me as soon as possible.
Thanks!
Shirley
