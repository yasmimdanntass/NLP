Subject: houston visit
Dear research and related group team members,
I will be visiting the houston office from monday 10 th july and hope to have
Another very useful information exchange, including updating you all on the
Activities in the london office by means of a presentation. For those of you
Who are unfamiliar with me, I have been looking after quantitative analysis
For the european markets for the last 3 + years, in particular focusing on
Derivatives pricing and risk management techniques (e. G. Load forecasting,
Inflation curve building, financial options on real power stations etc.) -
Look forward to meeting you all again soon.
Best regards,
Anjam ahmad
