Vince,
We had phone interview with rabI de. My impression is good. We should invite
Him for a formal interview.
He is a hands on person with wide range of experience (energy financing,
Derivatives trading, hedging, etc).
He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering &
Modeling.
