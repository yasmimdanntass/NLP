Vince:
I forgot to attach the final slam report, the file of the white paper,
The white paper calculations. The final slam report discusses the
Availability of service level agreement monitoring, and nms generally that
Meet ebs' s needs.
I am convinced that at a minimum ebs would gain the foundation of a great
Nms that will be critical to the success of ebs, and that ebs could actually
Gain the distributed machine tool that could be the foundation of the
Internet of the 21 st century. I hope we get the chance to prove this.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Mak
