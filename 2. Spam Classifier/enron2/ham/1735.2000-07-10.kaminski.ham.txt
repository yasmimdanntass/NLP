Dear vince,
Hi!, it' s only two weeks until the aust energy risk (17 - 19 july) seminar in

Otherwise, kirsty can organise for you,
Eg harbour view at the regent or convenience to the seminar location at the
Sheraton?
We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary" comforts" of home
When you are with us,
Elliott & david can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with
Phone etc
So you can use one of our pc to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let elliott or david kmow your requirements.
How long will you be with us?

There are several of us in the office who would like to take you for a
Meal (s)/show you the sights etc and
Discuss the latest research findings with you whilst you are in sydney eg var.
