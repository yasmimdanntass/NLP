Subject: may 9/10, 2000 seminar
My name is guillermo c? Novas, and I am regulatory and government affairs
Director for enron am, rica del sur (argentina).
I understand you spoke in a seminar that took place on may 9/10 where it was
Discussed: 1) effective power price modelling; 2) applying a real option
Approach for the valuation of power plants.
One consultant and researcher, who shares enron' s belief in open markets and
Competition (and therefore is helping us to open argentine energy markets),
Asked me if we could send him a copy of the booklet or slides that you and
Other speakers presented during the seminar.
If this is feasible, I would appreciate if you could send a copy of the
Material to me at enron am, rica del sur, located at: av. Eduardo madero 900 -
Piso 17 (1106) - buenos aires - argentina
Please, do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or
Require further information. I can be reached at the following number:
5411 - 4891 - 3600
Sincerely,
Guillermo.
