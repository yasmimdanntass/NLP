Subject: steve leppard
HI vince,
Hr is working on a mid - year salary review for london people that have a
Noticeable gap between their compensation at enron and what we would have to
Pay in the market for a replacement. They highlighted steve as someone with
A potential gap - particularly in light of what we' re seeing in our quant
Recruiting effort for credit trading and research.
I' d like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep steve happy and
Keep him at enron. There are several things I see we can do:
1) give him a mid - year pay increase to move him closer to market. I' m not
Sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token
Salary increase.
2) offer him more responsibility: what are your thoughts on timing for
Making steve the official head of the london research team? With my move to
Ebs, should we accelerate this? I think this is good way to keep him happy
And motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at
Year - end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater
Responsibility.
3) we have some people that we' re trying to get under long - term (3 - yr)
Contract with a 12 - month notice clause. Obviously anyone signing one of
These will want significant up - front compensation for being handcuffed.
We' ve not had a lot of success with these here in london, and I would prefer
To keep steve happy so he wants to stay with enron rather than contractually
Binding him to the job.
I' d value your thoughts on this.
Thanks,
Dale
