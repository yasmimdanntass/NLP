Subject: reimbursement of individually billed items
The memo distributed on june 27 on reimbursement of individually billed items
Requires
Clarification. The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate
Method
Of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc. Employees can continue to submit
These
Invoices to accounts payable for processing or pay these items with their
Corporate
American express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.
Either
Way is an acceptable way to process these small dollar high volume invoices.
