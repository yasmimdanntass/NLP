Subject: resume of a former fx trader
I am forwarding the resume of wendell licon who works for enron
In the hr department (executive compensation). He used to be an
Fx trader. I am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss
Is ready to release him.
I think, however, that you
Should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs.
