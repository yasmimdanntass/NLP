Subject: timesheets
Hello everyone:
Well it is almost that time again! I am going to try something different. I
Am
Forwarding you the time sheet by email. Save the document to whatever
Drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you
Had
And return to me by email. I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31 st) of
Each
Month.
This may work better than hand delivering.
Let me know what you think.
