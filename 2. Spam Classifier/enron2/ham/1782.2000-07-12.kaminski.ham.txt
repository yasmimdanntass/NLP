Subject: associate prc, martin lin
Dave,
You are representing martin lin, an associate currently in the research
Group, at the mid - year prc. We would like to promote martin to a manager
Position in the research group, so you will need to nominate him for
Promotion at the prc meeting for us.
Martin has spent the last four months supporting ebs. His primary project
Has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of
The media - cast product running on the ebs network. This type of analysis is
Critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in
Trying to service, for example, the blockbuster deal. Martin has already
Come up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive
Contractor from lucent who is under contract to support this modelling
Effor. Prior to supporting ebs, martin used his engineering skills (b. S.
Caltech, ph. D. U. Of texas in ee) to create models of regional power
Transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion
Constraints.
In our internal pre - ranking meeting we felt that martin was deserving of a
Rating of superior due to his technical excellence, his excellent attitude
And work ethic, and his ability to move projects forward with minimal
Supervision.
Regards,
Stinson
