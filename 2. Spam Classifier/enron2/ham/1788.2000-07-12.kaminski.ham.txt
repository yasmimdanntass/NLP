Subject: our meeting
Vince:
I enjoyed meeting you last week to discuss my application to join your group.
Please keep my inquiry confidential for now.
If selected, I think your group would greatly benefit from my diverse
Skill - set including modeling skills utilizing excel, access, and
Bloomberg as well as graphing, statistical, and other quantitative abilities,
Especially in the meteorology field.
I am particularly interested in being able to discover vital information
Which may affect the markets (e. G. Pulp/paper, interest rates, weather) as
Well as arriving at a new variable which captures all market variables into
One which may be followed and forecasted for each of the groups.
Furthermore, I am truly committed to adding value to your group, including
Making significant contributions,
And am sanguine about my ability to ensure that these achievements are
Well - received.
I have met many people at enron thus far and am able to utilize these
Strategic alliances by knowing who may be able
To assist your group in the quest for information on different projects. By
Accessing information quickly, both internal and
External to the firm, the group would be able to extraordinarily benefit from
This diligence in addition, by seeking greater efficiencies in my work,
I have been able to be instrumental in accumulating additional
Responsibilities.
Most importantly, I have the mathematical acumen and insight to ensure the
Continued growth and prosperity of your group.
As a research - oriented individual, I am clearly interested in pursuing a
Position in your group.
If selected, I would be able to bring my diverse experience, including
Financial modeling and derivatives, from my tenure at
Enron and cibc world markets.
I look forward to meeting with select members of your group.
Thanks,
David
