I will be on the call. I may disconnect around 4: 00 to attend the traders'
Daily meeting.
A couple of issues:
1. Would it be possible to get gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not
Have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in
His apartment is the increasing cost of his houston stay.
2. It is getting noisier here. Gappy and I are wandering if we could get
Office space downstairs (that we share). We will maintain presence on 44, but
We will be able to discuss when needed.
