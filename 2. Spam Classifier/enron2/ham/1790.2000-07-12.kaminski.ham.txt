Subject: timesheets
Hello all:
I am afraid I did not allow enough time to do the time sheets by asking for
Them by the 15 th and 31 st. I really need these sheets by the 13 th and 28 th
Of each month as it takes a good half day to enter all the new times in the
Time sheets.
I am resending this, because as of now I have received very few timesheets
And I really need to start imputting the time.
Thanks!
Shirley

Hello everyone:
Well it is almost that time again! I am going to try something different. I
Am
Forwarding you the time sheet by email. Save the document to whatever
Drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you
Had
And return to me by email. I will need this by the 15 and 30 (or 31 st) of
Each
Month.
This may work better than hand delivering.
Let me know what you think.
