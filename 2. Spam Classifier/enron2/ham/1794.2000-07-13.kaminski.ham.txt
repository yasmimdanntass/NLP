Subject: monte - carlo library
Stinson,
I have created a directory (o:\research\common\projects\options\mclib)
To hold our monte - carlo models we developed in the past.
I have the following mc models:
1. Asian option with two - point vol structure
2. Asian barrier option
3. Asian spread option
4. Time spread option
5. Asian digital option
Do we want to include models using american monte - carlo?
I have
1. American spread option
2. Option on min or max of n assets with n as an input
3. Omicron option model with 3 price processes
I suggest that all of us save a copy of monte - carlo models in this directory,
From these,
We can build a general monte - carlo library. We can also calculate the mc
Greeks more
Efficiently now.
