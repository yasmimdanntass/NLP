Dear mr kaminski
I am delighted to say that the printed conference brochure is now available
And our logistics team will be mailing them out, along with the speaker
Guideline packs (including information on hotel discounts etc), in the next
Couple of weeks. You will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing
Campaign.
In the interim, please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference
Brochure for your perusal. (I did not want to send you the complete 12 pages
As it would clog up your email!) the full colour version can be found on our
Website at www. Icbi. Uk. Com/powerisk
I hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line - up of topics is possibly
One of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong
International interest. In particular the executive summit day on e - business
And power trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to
Attend either the summit day or one of our two intensive post conference
Workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all
Reservations be made in advance.
I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in
Attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the
Enclosed details to them. To make things easy, I have attached a booking form
Which should be faxed to + 44 20 7915 5101. IcbI would be happy to offer a 10%
Discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations.
Finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact
Our logistics manager clare capel on + 44 20 7915 5198. Of course for any
Programme related issues, please drop me an email or call me on + 44 20 7915
5194.
I look forward to seeing you in october for what promises to be excellent and
Informative week.
Kind regards
