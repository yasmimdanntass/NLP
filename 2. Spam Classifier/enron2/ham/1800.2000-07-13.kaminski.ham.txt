Subject: updating your profile information in the gis system
As the global vp/md mid - year prc draws closer, I want to take the opportunity
To stress to you the importance of updating your profile information in the
Gis system. Details on your current responsibilities, employment history,
Skills and education should have been updated by 7 july 2000. For those of
You that have not opened your profile in gis, I urge you to do so as soon as
Possible to ensure that your profiles are current and complete.
Gis is accessible via the hrweb home page on the intranet. You may go to
Hrweb. Enron. Com and look for the gis link, or just type eglobal. Enron. Com on
The command line of the browser.
Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
