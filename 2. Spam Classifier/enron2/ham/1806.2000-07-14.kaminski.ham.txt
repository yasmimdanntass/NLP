Subject: re: is there any chance you could chair a session at the conference?
Dear joel,
Will be glad to help out but had a look at the stream 2 on monday
And it is 1120 am - 520 pm covering three sessions!!!
Could I suggest that I take the 1120 am - lunch session and you can find another
Speaker (s) from day 2
To chair the afternoon session (s).
I am flexible if you need me to take a different time on the monday.

Would be a great help is you' re available.
