HI shane,
Thanks for your e - mail. We actually sent the 9 of the 11 chapters off to the
Typesetter today and I will forward you our word documents in the morning.
I' ve been travelling a lot to the uk at the moment and so haven' t spent much
Time with the student myself. Are you going to te energy confernece next
Week, perhaps we can meet up there?
Good to hear about the weather. We are actually going to run a two day
Course thru uts on weather derivatives the first weekend of september. Feel
Free to tell your potential clients about it if you think it will bring up
The industry knowledge. Maybe we can associate your name with the course
Somehow which might help both of us?
C.
