Dale,
To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
That sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to
55, 000
With a sign - on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.
I shall be in australia next week. If you need
Any additional intervention from us, please, call stinson.
