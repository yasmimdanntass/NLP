I agree with vince. Ideally, this visit would supplement rather than
Duplicate effort. However, on the front end, I would prefer a little
Overkill to underkill - especially with respect to the var process. I would
Defer to anjam/tanya' s opinion as to what is necessary to get an initial
Comfort level. Remember that this is the first cut, but it will need to be
Refined over time to the point where it is credible enough to force someone
To take a position down based on the calculatiion. If this causes some
Heartburn please refer those people to me.

Lloyd,
Speaking from experience, I think that it' s critical for tanya and anjam to
Visit mg in new york
And establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk
Management systems
Requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions
Between it and quants
Will be very helpful.
Vince

Tanya,
I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - i' ll be at mg
With andreas today and we' ll call you. Most of these points have already
Been covered with anjam in any case. I' m also attaching a file downloaded
From mercur (mg' s risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions
For each metal in each entity. You can fairly easily create tables and graph
What you want to see. We can talk today about getting a full deal download.
Regards
