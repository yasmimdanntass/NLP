Subject: var methodology change
Gentlemen,
Below is a plan of action for moving along with the var methodology change
Related to forward - forward volatility:
1. Finalize the methodology proposed (research/market risk)
- determine the time period used to calculated forward - forward vols vs.
Correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
- stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does
Not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%
2. Get approval for the methodology change from rick buy (see draft of the
Memo attached) - john lavorato and john sherriff
3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment
(research/it)
4. Test the new methodology (market risk, traders)
5. Migrate into production (research/it)
Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone' s expectations.
Vlady.
