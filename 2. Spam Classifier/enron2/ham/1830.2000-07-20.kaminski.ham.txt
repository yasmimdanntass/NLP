Subject: request for visit and meeting
HI grant, we met briefly a couple of months ago. I work with pedro in the
Colombia office. We are working closely with ecopetrol (colombia' s
State - owned oil company) on a very important deal, and some of their highest
Ranking officials (3 of them) will like to visit our head quarters in early
August, to share some ideas on risk management tools (very general concepts
That can obviously be disclosed).
My assumption is that vince and your - self are the perfect people to have the
Meeting with. Several consulting firms have advice ecopetrol to get in touch
With enron when referring to advance risk management techniques. Do you think
This is possible? Please let me know, this means a great deal for this
Office, but I also know you guys are extremely busy. Thanks,
Carlos e
