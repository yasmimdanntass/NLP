Please use the budget format sheet attached below. There is an error in the
Executive summary sheet of the original file. Hope this does not cause
Anyone undue problems.
Thanks.

Attached are the guidelines and the budget template for the 2001 - 2003
Operating & strategic plan.
A budget template should be completed for each cost center in your
Area/group that will be utilized for 2001. All budgets are due to corp.
Financial planning no later than close of business august 14, 2000.
While corporate financial planning has attempted to make the process as easy
As possible, we know questions will arise. Please feel free to contact me at
X 37775 with any questions or problems.
Thanks in advance.
