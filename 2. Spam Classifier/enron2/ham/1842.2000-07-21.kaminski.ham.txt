Subject: re: manabu matsumoto
HI lucy/natalie
Given that manabu is perceived as the" specialist" type, and probably
Shouldn' t go straight into the gas trading group, this may have implications
For research headcount if he' s considered a good non - a & a hire.
I' ll be spending the next couple of weeks canvassing opinions from various
Vps and mds over their preferred size, role and style of research group for
Europe. I think we should delay manabu' s second round interviews for a while.
Cheers,
Steve

Steve,
I am out of the office tomorrow and was just wondering if you' d had a chance
To think about the interview list for manabu?
If you get a list together, natalie will be able start working on it -
Alternatively I will catch up with you on monday.
Natalie - just so you know manabu will be coming in for second round but not
For the a & a programme - probably a specialist in steve' s group (we' ll pass it
Over to commercial support next week)
Cheers
Lucy
