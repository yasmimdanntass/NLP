Subject: cmu students
I have given your email to richard bryant, who is the director of the comp.
Fin. Program at cmu. No doubt he will be in touch. Here' s a link:
I feel that I should mention something: from my experience at cmu, there are
Three types of students. Those that work very very hard and are basically
Ethical; those that cheat their way through school, and the sharks. It is
Very difficult to distinguish between the groups when interviewing. In my
Class of about 30 students, there were three sharks, about six or seven hard
Workers, and then there was everyone else. Anyway, for what its worth!
