My number is 254 - 710 - 4473 (office) and 254 - 757 - 0852 (home). The editor of
The journal of applied corporate finance is doing a special issue on energy
Finance for the fall and I want to see if you and vince would like to put
Something together describing enron' s basic business model. I would love
To join you if you would like and I can actually draft the paper with your
Help. I' ll get in touch with you on monday. Have a great weekend.
John
P. S. Mitch taylor was in class today and did his usual great job. I sure
Enjoy using enron as my" premier company example".
