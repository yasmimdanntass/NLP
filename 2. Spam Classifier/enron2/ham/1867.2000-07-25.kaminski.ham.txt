Subject: mg metals var preliminary modella - subject to minor
Updating/correcting
Dear all,
I am leaving the office now, and sending you the preliminary model la for mg
Metals var that tanya, cantekin, kirstee have put together. We are now in a
Position to look at the var by metal for positions as of 19 th july 2000,
Subject to some data that needs updating/correcting; we still need to update
Some information/data flow processes as follows: -
I) factor loadings for silver, gold, cocoa beans and tc (treatment charge for
Copper concentrate)
Ii) check correlations between nickel and alu and nickel and copper (I got
Different answers to houston)
Iii) ensure latest forward price curves are included (perhaps through live
Link to telerate/reuters)
Iiia) price for silver is wrong (units should be $per troy ounce), and
Similarly for gold (price should be $per troy ounce), also we need cocoa
Bean forward curve
Iv) find a better way to extract positional information from mg metals/link
To the spreadsheet in an automated fashion
V) add" minor" metals like cobalt, palladium, platinum, cadmium etc. (n. B. We
Have 1, 093 troy ounces of palladium short posn and 3, 472 troy ounces platinum
Long as of 19 th july)
Please feel free to add to this list if I have missed anything; I believe
That we have most of the bases covered in respect of issues to resolve ahead
Of the deadline of 7 th august and fully expect that we will deliver.
Regards,
Anjam ahmad
