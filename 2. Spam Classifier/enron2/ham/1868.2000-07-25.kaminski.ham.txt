Subject: re: final pivot table for mg metals globals positions data
Dear all,
Please see attached spreadsheet - we will have to think of a way to automate
The position update - right now it' s a manual process to convert the text
File that andreas sends us to proper spreadsheet format and then pivot table
The results - only takes about 20 minutes to do this however. Note that the
Version la var model links via vlookup to the spreadsheet attached (as you
Know, we have to use vlookup because mg does not necessarily have positions
In all forward months, whilst the pivot table only produces numbers for
Forward months with a position).
Regards,

Our pivot table; we noticed that copper position for 19 th july has option
Included but this is not reported in mercur - I guess we should include the
5, 248 tonnes for the copper option for 2000. 09, but we won' t show any gamma.

HI tanya,
We are using the data for 19 th july from andreas - see file attached. We are
Using this because we can reconcile to mercur print out that we got from
Andreas last wednesday. If you don' t mind, perhaps cantekin can try again
With this new sheet attached. We already looked at it, but would like to see
What cantekin can come up with independently. I think the positions changed
A lot from 3 rd july (your data) to 19 th july.
Thanks,
Anjam & kirstee
