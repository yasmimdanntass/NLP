Subject: metals cross correlations
Dear all,
I have completed the cross - correlation study for the seven metals we have
Data for - will complete for gold, silver and cocoa. I have also attached
The spreadsheet. Correlations based on log - returns, 21, 42 or 63 business
Days for either front month only or average of entire futures curve - please
See data below or drill into spreadsheet. We can choose the most appropriate
Time - bucket and whether to use front month or" average of curve" data.
Regards,
