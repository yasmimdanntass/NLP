Subject: mg metals - london research responsibility
Dear all,
Please ensure that all requests for metals research support in london are
Directed/forwarded to me in the first instance (e. G. Option pricing, var).
This is to ensure speediest response time and to avoid duplication of effort
As well as confusion on the part of our mg counterparts due to multiple
(duplicated) requests for information.
Tanya and I are currently developing version la of the var models for mg
Metals. Vince, ted and mg metals are looking to tanya and I to provide
Leadership in this area for the integration effort and after production of
Var v. 1 a, I will look to pass on responsibility for mg metals var systems
Integration to kirstee hewitt for the london side.
Regards,
Anjam ahmad
