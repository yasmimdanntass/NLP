Subject: mec
Thank you for participating in yesterday' s meeting. We spoke with harvey and
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.
There is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
Development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one
Thing we also want, people. I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
The possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
Part of a potential investment and strategic relationship. Given our
Resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that
Sees the greatest strategic impact from mec' s development.
