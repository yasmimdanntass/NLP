Subject: ena analysts and associates
I have just received word from ted bland that no one has responded to this
Memo. Please re - read the following memo and respond to ted by july 31, 2000.
Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
As you know the ena otc is actively working with the analyst and associate
Program to develop greater talent flow into ena. We are presently working on
A number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly
Improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also
Need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ena
Regarding a & a resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.
In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead for your
Groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about a & a' s
In your area are passed through you to either ted bland (ena recuitment team
Lead - x 35275) or jana giovannanI (ena liaison from the aa program - x 39233)
Or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our
A & a resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this
Regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you
May optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any a & a
Resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.
In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you
To a regular bI - monthly meeting to discuss ena a & a matters. We will confirm
The first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer
Another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply
Their name as soon as possible.
Please call with any questions.
