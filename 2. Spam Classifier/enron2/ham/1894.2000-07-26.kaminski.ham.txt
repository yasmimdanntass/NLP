Subject: update on mg var model
HI vince,
Thanks for the e - mail. We have included live links to price curves through
Reuters quotes via telerate bridge but we still have static curves for gold
And cocoa. Kirstee is talking to andreas in ny to obtain position files on a
Daily basis, addressing point 2) in your e - mail, as well as looking into
Longer term integration issues. Cantekin and I have agreed the correct
Correlations for the metals between us, but cantekin is currently checking
The correlations for silver and gold. Preliminary results based on positions
As of 19 th july are as follows:
We noticed that position mapping at the front months can change var
Significantly.
As you stated, kirstee hewitt will now be assuming responsibility for further
Modifications to the model on the london side and to this end I have ensured
That kirstee is put in touch with key personnel like andreas (andreas will be
In the london office next week) and has access to all the information she
Needs.
Regards,
Anjam ahmad
