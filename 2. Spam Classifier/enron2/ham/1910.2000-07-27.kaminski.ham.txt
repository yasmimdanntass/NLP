I actually called stan horton' s office yesterday to find out if they knew
Anything about the aga membership, and cindy stark who works with stan
Informed me that stan cancelled our associate membership with aga effective
January, 2000. I called jay copan with aga back and left him a voicemail
With the information. I asked him to call me if he had any questions and i
Have not heard back from him. I' ll considered it closed unless I hear back
From him.

I believe that stan horton' s office handled the dues for aga.
