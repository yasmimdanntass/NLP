Richard,
Please, let me know what the timetable is. I would like to talk to anjam a
Few days before
To break the news to him. I hope I can save him for the company and offer him
A position in houston.
We desperately need skills he has.

John,
I propose accelerating steve' s move to head the research group here. It
Makes sense to include this as part of the mid - year prc process by giving him
A tangible reward along with his performance feedback.
Thoughts?

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here. We are still trying to fill
Dale' s structuring role as well so part of the question is
How we announce steve' s lead research role relative to when we know who will
Take dale' s spot. Perhaps we should just
Move forward with the steve announcement the day that dale moves full time to
Ebs. I will ask richard lewis to take the lead
In working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes
To the organization.
But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have steve here. He is a
Wonderfull asset to our efforts.
Thanks!
John

John,
I am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group.
As you know, dale surbey, who was managing the london unit of the research
Group,
Is moving to ebs. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
Talent we have currently
In london.
Given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston, it' s time
To nominate one member of the research group for a management position.
My recommendation is steve leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
Technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader,
Highly
Respected by his peers and internal customers. Steve has a very high energy
Level
And is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent.
His promotion is likely to cause anjam' s departure form enron. I value
Technical
Skills of anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don' t think he is the
Same caliber
As steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
Houston
For 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in houston, would be a
Sufficient
Incentive to keep him in enron. By the way, his performance feedback has
Greatly improved.
Please, let me know what you think.
Vince
