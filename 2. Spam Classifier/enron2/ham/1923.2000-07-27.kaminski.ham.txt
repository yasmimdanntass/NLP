Nick,
Vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you august visit to enron.
Vince and I are free almost any date except august 14 and 15 th, but we would
Like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other
Key ebs executives such as kevin hannon and perhaps ken rice and john
Echols. If you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates, i
Will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals.
By the way, giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good
Impression on everyone he has worked with. It' s been a real pleasure having
Him here for the summer.
Regards,
Stinson
