Subject: reminder
Stinson (and vince - - don' t think your e - mail address is correct)
This is just a reminder about the" care package" of enron cases and
Materials that you guys were going to send to me.
Stinson, please convey this request on to vince because I think the e - mail
Address I have is an old one.
Thanks and have a great weekend.
