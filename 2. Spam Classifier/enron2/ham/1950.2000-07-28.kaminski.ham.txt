Subject: var numbers for the 26 th
HI andreas,
I have run the var model for the 26 th july and have attached a zip file of
The results:
The total var is $4, 170, 653 and the cu position is $1, 852, 876.
I have had trouble getting hold of you so I thought I would summarised what i
Wanted to talk about (also I thought
I would give your ears a rest!)
Basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday (we briefly
Discussed it earlier).
The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a
5 day period of adjustment to calculate
The risk (in this case it is called capital at risk). The var calculation for
Our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
Will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt (5) or 2. 24.
Since:
Old risk factor (%) = 1. 65 * (std of the price movement) = 3. 99%
New daily risk factor = 3. 99/2. 24 = 1. 78% which actually equates to std
Of approx 1. 1% a day.
I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we
Are showing for cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1. 2% daily.
Using this new risk factor for the daily var the cu positions would give a
Var (for the 19 th) of approx $2 m which is less that the
Figure we estimated ($3, 100, 568).
The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term
Structure of the price curve/vol curve and position
Curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means
That it is difficult to compare the numbers.
I hope that this helps to explain our number.
Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,
Cheers
Kirstee
