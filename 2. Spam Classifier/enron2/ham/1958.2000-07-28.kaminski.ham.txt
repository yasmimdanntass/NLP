Subject: re: clayton vernon
Thanks for the e - mail. Please let me know if clayton does not honor his
Commitment to complete his current project. I am giving clayton an
Opportunity (next 6 months) to prove he can add value to our operation
Creating state of the art decision support tools. If he fails, I will take
The necessary steps.
Thank you.
