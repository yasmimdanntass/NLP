This correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question
Pertaining to the type of research that should be introduced to enron.
On tuesday, april 4 th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area," the bakersfield
California" ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding
From the u. S. Congress set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of
Methane hydrate. This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy
Source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development.
According to this article, the ice - like deposits of frozen methane have an
Energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels
Combined.
I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it.
Send me you fax number or call me at enron wind corp. 661 - 823 - 6433.
Also when I was in engineering student back in 1985, I did an independent
Senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to
Extract hydrate from the sea floor. If you are interested, I could e - mail you
A copy of my thesis explaining this proposed method.
