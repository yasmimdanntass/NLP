Subject: regulatory var
Tentative agenda for the research lunch meeting on wednesday, august 2 nd at
11: 30 am:
Objective: develop a methodology and a model for estimating risks of the ees
Regulatory portfolio.
Discussion items:
1. Elements of the regulatory portfolio
- transmission and distribution (t & d) positions
- bundled tariffs (full utility tariffs that are in place prior to
Deregulation)
- competitive transition charges (ctc) positions
- diversification between the three risk elements
2. Risk drivers in each bucket (scott stoness of ees to provide more detail)
- t & d: interest rates
- bundled tariffs: regulatory decisions, power prices, interest rates,
Inflation
- ctc: power prices, fuel prices, generation valuation, generation stack,
Regulatory decisions
3. Position aggregation parameters (scott stoness of ees to provide
Suggestions)
- by nerc region
- by state
- by utility
- by utility tariff
4. Model environment
- excel
- grms/risktrac
- other
5. Var parameters
- correlations
- factor loadings (1 - factor model?)
- other
6. Ees specific issues
- the size of ctc positions is impacted by the roll - off date, which is
Subject to change due to a number of factors (jump diffusion?)
- t & d and bundled tariffs do not move daily, but rather once every 2 - 3 years
(event driven?)
Thanks, vlady.
Ps: shirley, could you please make the lunch arrangements accordingly.
