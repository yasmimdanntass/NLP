And as a comparison the previous days figures were:
This shows some increase in var for aluminium, copper and lead. The prices
For gold and cocoa beans have not been updated
As we still do not have a live feed to bloomberg/reuters. I will be working
On this with cantekin and andreas should also be able to
Provide some more historical data.
Also, after having a discussion with andreas here in london we should
Probably reduce the vol we are using for tc - we are taking the cu price
Vol as a proxy which is a too high. However, assuming the the other
Assumptions we have made around the tc (ie simulating a parallel shift in
The curve and
Including no term structure to the price curve) the vol estimate is a
Conservative one.
Cheers
