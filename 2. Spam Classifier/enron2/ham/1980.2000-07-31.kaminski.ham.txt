Subject: reminder
Hello everyone:
Vince has asked me to send the following as a reminder:
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for
Cleaning the conference rooms after meetings. For many visitors to enron
A conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.
Last thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch
Boxes
On the table. Please, don' t embarrass me by having to point out to you that
Your mothers
Don' t work here.
Vince
