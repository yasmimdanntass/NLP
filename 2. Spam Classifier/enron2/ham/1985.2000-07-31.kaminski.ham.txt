Subject: message 4
Dear dr. Kaminski,
This is a message of discussing the problem in lacima' s paper. I think that
Glen dixon has told you there is a fault in the paper written by dr. Clewlow
And dr. Strickland. It is understandable to have some errors in their work.
People always make mistakes.
Actually, I found the problem in appendix a of their paper. They can' t prove
The eq. A 4 rigorously. There is something wrong in mathematical
Interpretation. If you like, I can give you a full analysis of this problem.
Ps: attached with their paper.
Best regard
Quentin
