History in nominal terms
For a us onshore louisiana natural gas price (or a texas wellhead price) and
A uk landed beach price for the past 15 years? I am gathering historical data
For jim o hara for our colombia pipeline in south america and these are among
The series of data they are seeking. They would like the data
From a published source in an electronic file if possible.. Their timetable
Is by cob weds this week. Thank you for your help. Margaret
Mike do you agree with me? Please, ask elena to check what price info is
Available at xmim.

Margaret,
The prices going back 15 years are not too informative (for the first 5
Years), as he industry was still regulated.
We shall try to get you the us series as soon as possible.
