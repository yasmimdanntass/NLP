Subject: vince does your group have a monthly or a quarterly price history in
Nominal terms
For a us onshore louisiana natural gas price (or a texas wellhead price) and
A uk landed beach price for the past 15 years? I am gathering historical data
For jim o hara for our colombia pipeline in south america and these are among
The series of data they are seeking. They would like the data
From a published source in an electronic file if possible.. Their timetable
Is by cob weds this week. Thank you for your help. Margaret
