Subject: economic espionage act presentation - august 15 th
You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:" acquiring
Information: trade secrets and the economic espionage act (eea)". Daniel
Waltz, of the law firm patton boggs llp, is a leading expert on the eea and
Will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.
Congress passed the eea in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate
America collects, uses, and protects valued information. In addition to
Explaining some of the intricacies of the eea, dan waltz will include
" hypothetical" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines)
To illustrate his points.
This event is sponsored by ena' s competitive analysis and business controls
(cabc) group and is supported by ena legal. This event kicks - off cabc' s
Competitive intelligence standards program, which seeks to raise awareness of
Issues relevant both to enron' s practitioners and senior consumers of
Competitive intelligence. This particular speaking engagement is designed to
Raise awareness of the eea' s legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate
Thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well
As how we might better protect enron' s own proprietary information. I
Believe the topic of the eea is especially relevant, given that we find
Ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.
All cabc staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are
Inviting a small number of other enron employees who are engaged in aspects
Of serious competitive intelligence. Select executives like yourselves are
Being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that
You think might benefit from attending this event.
The eea presentation is set for august 15, 1: 30 - 3: 00 pm, in the 50 th floor
Conference room. Please rsvp to either myself or sharon purswell. Hope to
See you there.
P. S. By the way, our next speaker segment in the cI standards program will
Concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the" foreign corrupt
Practices act (fcpa)," and will likely be scheduled for the fall.
