Beth,
Thanks.
Dhabol is one. There should be 2 more case studies we used.
One about old egs, the 2 nd about tva options.
2 - 3 copies will be sufficient.

I just found some copies! How many do you need and I will have them
Delivered to you.
They are the case about the dabhol project in india. Is that the one you
Were thinking of?

Beth,
I have a favor to ask. Do we have copies of harvard business school
Case studies about enron? We use these case studies during super saturdays.
I need a few copies. This is for prof. John martin.
