I know you' re very busy, so you might not have heard this...
Apparently, the board will meet this week to approve the sale of * all * of
Enron international' s assets to a member of hte saudI royal family, the same
Prince who once invested heavily in citicorp to bail it out.
The source of this is someone I trust.
