Subject: sap time sheets on the o:\research\common drive
Hello everyone:
If you were not able to access the spreadsheet we created for your time,
On the o:\research\common\sap timesheets site, please let me know.
If a box came up with" read only" on it, you may not have access to the o: \
Drive. Let me know and I will issue an srrs request for access.
Thanks.
