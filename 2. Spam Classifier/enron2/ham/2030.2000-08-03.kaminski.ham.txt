If d - g agrees to release it sooner.
Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to
Discuss the escrow situation. Vince mentioned that you had suggested that
Your attorney keep the software in escrow. Is your attorney a u. S.
Attorney? It seems like I may have recalled that way back in march you might
Have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney. Is that the
Same person? Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo
Practitioner? Basically, if you could just provides some additional
Information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.
We normally would use an escrow company to put the software in escrow. We
Have dealt with a company here in the u. S. Called dsI technology. I will
Check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.
Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow,
We will red - line the agreement to reflect such changes and e - mail it back to
You for your review.
I look forward to hearing from you.
