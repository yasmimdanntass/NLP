Subject: enterprise risk management
Dear vince,
?
Thanks for your call the other day regarding eprm' s upcoming enterprise risk
Management conference. We seem to be making progress and are pulling
Together some interesting subjects for inclusion this year. I am currently
At a stage where there are plenty of possible sessions and over the next
Week I will be able to decide of which will stay and which will go.
?
I have attached a file that gives an indication of the topics that have been
Identified so far. Although I have bullet points for the sessions I would
First like to identify interested parties and then work with them to develop
A session that reflects their particular expertise and experience. I also
Think that by continuously developing the points we can make greater
Allowances for continuity between each participant.
?
Based on our discussion I would be extremely interested in inviting you to
Lead a session on the main conference. You seemed to have an interesting
View on operational risk and the particular challenges that are presented
Within the energy industry. This session will run on thursday, november
16 th. The title is reasonably broad at this stage and any suggestions are
Welcome.
?
Your overall views on the current conference content is also welcome and if
You feel that another session is more suited to your work do not hesitate to
Contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
?
Yours sincerely,
?
