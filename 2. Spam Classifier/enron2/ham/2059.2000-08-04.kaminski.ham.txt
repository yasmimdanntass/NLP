Jeff: good talking with you earlier this week and happy to hear that your
Conversation with jeff skilling was such a positive one. I am looking
Forward to working with you, vince and mark palmer in the near future to put
In place a comprehensive plan to maximize the enron/wharton relationship in a
Number of different areas. I also know that a number of the faculty will be
Extremely pleased to learn of this news and will be quick to get the ball
Rolling.
As promised, I am forwarding a document outlining all on campus sponsorship
Opportunities, minus the student business plan competition, for the upcoming
School year. Please review and pass it on the celeste roberts, for whom I do
Not have an accurate e - mail address. There are a number of student
Conferences that you may wish to consider participating in as a means for
Getting the enron name in front of them. Please don' t hesitate to contact me
With any questions you may have or requests for additional information.
I will also contact the career management office and ask that they call
Celeste to discuss career orientation panel sessions. I know that you must
Plan your schedule well in advance and will do my best to facilitate that
Process.
Thanks again for all you are doing to bring our two institutions together.
It is important and makes a big difference.
Look forward to hearing from you soon.
Tom
