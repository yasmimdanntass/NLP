Krishna,
Osman has informed me that he has been requested to provide research services
To a larger number of clients in ees, leaving him less time to contribute to
Our work here at the eam desk. While I am happy for him and believe that the
Company will benefit from his services, I am concerned that he may not be
Available at a crucial time in the development of the eam option strategy.
The eam desk is continuing to develop standard models for the bulk of our ecm
Projects. We have hired 4 people in the past month and all of them will be
Working by early september. Osman provides an important link for our new
Staff to several core areas of our business. First, his experience with
Modeling and energy analysis are invaluable. Second, as we move to treating
Our projects as options, and pricing them as such, osman will be needed to
Assist us in creating auditable methods to assess savings volatility.
I am expecting two of the team members to start in san francisco in the near
Future. My request is for osman to be available to this team for one day a
Week for the next several months, preferably until christmas.
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
Steve kromer
