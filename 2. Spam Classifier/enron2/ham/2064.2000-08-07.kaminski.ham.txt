Subject: re: mit/aa lab - next meeting
Amy,
I think that rick causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a
Reasonable decision.
We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let rick obtain
Clarification of some issues from aa. I would agree that aa came up with a
Rather
Vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

Vince: can you shed any light on this? I' m confused (really confused)....
Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only
By kean, buy and koening? And
Do you think this means that we shouldn' t meet on thurs?
Personally, I think enron really needs to meet on thurs to buckle down and
Start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the
Lab.
From a practical perspective, if we can' t get what we want from this whole
Thing, rick' s issue of" where aa is going with this" is really a mute point,
Isn' t it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort.
Would appreciate your insight and advice.
Thanks.
Amy

I have discussed with aa and they are following up. If I am the agenda, i
Would cancel the meeting and when I hear from aa, I will e mail everyone. I
Would suggest we not hold a meeting until kean, buy, koenig and I can all
Come so that we can truly move forward (or decide not to). Let me know what
You decide. Thanks. Rick
