This week. Following that meeting, i
Will provide an update to you regarding our progress.

Subject: enron - nevrl - aa meeting on july 27
Dear amy:
Thank you and your colleagues for taking the time to video - conference with
Us at mit and aa professionals associated with nevrl. I enjoyed the
Exchange and was left impressed by the technical savvy and keen interest in
Research on part of enron. I look forward to hearing from you sometime
Soon.
As I recall, we agreed that enron would forward a few issues/questions that
Nevrl could potentially address. Once we have a meeting of minds on the
Set of issues, we can discuss further how best to collaborate and
Accomplish our goals. I believe both sides would benefit immensely. Mit
Faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive
Some answers you are looking for!
With best regards,
S. P.
