Vince, alice has strong qualities for a sr admin asst. Vince, have we posted
This position on the job posting board? If so, great. If not, we need to
Post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates. Otherwise,
Existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their
Advancement within enron but hiring externally. If we have not posted this,
I will have the recruiter contact shirley so shirley can give us a job
Description. Then we can post and interview anita simultaneously. Please
Let me know asap if this has been posted. Thanks.
