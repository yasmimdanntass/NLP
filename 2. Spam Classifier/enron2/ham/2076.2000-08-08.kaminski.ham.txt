Stinson,
Enclosed are the details of the cplex purchase. If everyone agrees, I will
Assume that ebs is responsible for 1/3 of the cost (with taxes etc. Must be
Close to $15, 000).
Krishna and grant, what do you think?

Subject: revised ilog quote 5 - 25 - 00
HI chonawee,
You are right, I did make a mistake on the calculation, though it isn' t
Exactly 2/3 of the previous 3 pak quote. Sorry about that and so glad you
Caught it. I multiplied by 1. 5 and I meant to use 1. 3. We have discounted
Deployment paks which we discount by quantity. Our chart starts with a 3
Pak so I took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1. 3 to get
14, 560. 00. For 2 deployments, I take $4, 500 for one, plus 10% off for the
Second license 4, 050, then times 1. 3 = 11, 115. 00. Here is the revised
Quote. I checked the other numbers again and they are correct. Again, I am
Sorry for the mistake.
Regards,
