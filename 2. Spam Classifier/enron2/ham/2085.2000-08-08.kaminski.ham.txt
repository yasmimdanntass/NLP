Subject: hello from vince kaminskI at enron
Shmuel,
I hope you remember me. I visited you together with aram sogomonian, a
Good friend of mine, a few years ago. I am currently responsible, among
Other things, for recruiting graduates with finance and/or technical
Backgrounds at the university of berkeley. I would be glad to give you a
Call and talk more about the details of our program. My colleague,
Ashleybaxter, from the analyst/associate program at enron would join me
As well.
I am sending you a copy of the brochure about the analyst/associate
Program.
