Subject: houston research opportunity
Dear vince I would like to make
The suggestion that we make this opportunity a one - year assignment working
With tanya, and then re - evaluate the situation at the end of the year in
Terms a new role for me in houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.
The alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re - joining enron
Corp is too dramatic and requires me to" burn bridges" and my return to enron
Europe would be difficult. Also, I would lose the valuable support
Structures available to me in london. The amount of any fixed costs
(flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely
Reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they
Justify making the contract a three year (local) one.
I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &
Value - added at enron europe, the value of several million pounds I have
Identified & justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an
" excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also
" excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i. E. My
Existing enron europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one - off
Allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).
Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,
Anjam
