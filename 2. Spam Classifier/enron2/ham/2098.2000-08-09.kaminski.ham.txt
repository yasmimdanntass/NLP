Nick,
Sorry for the delay in my reply. August the 21 st will work the best, since
Jim fallon (head trader for bandwidth) will be out the following week. We
Will set up a meeting with him. Kevin hannon is out, however, and there is
No need for you to stay for dinner if you prefer to head back earlier in the
Afternoon.
Should you want help in making any travel arrangements, our assistant
Shirley crenshaw (713 853 5290) would be happy to help you.
Thanks and look forward to your visit,
Stinson
