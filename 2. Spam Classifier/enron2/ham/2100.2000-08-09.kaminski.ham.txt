Subject: talk to us
Over the last several years, we' ve received numerous questions and candid
Comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our espeak
Sessions and through the office of the chairman online mailbox and
Voicemail. While espeak is an open, informal chat between employees and
Management, the office of the chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are
Designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose
Anonymity. We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your
Thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond
To your questions and concerns. This is the kind of work environment we all
Must strive for at enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us
Comments about the things that are important to you.
Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us
Anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions. We now have a
Way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality. In the future, when
We receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the
Question and our response will be posted on emeet. This will allow us to
Answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an
Opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since emeet is
An open discussion board.
Remember: you can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
- email to office of the chairman, or
- office of the chairman voicemail box at 713 - 853 - 7294, which is a
Confidential call
Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our vision and
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company. So don' t
Be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind. We want to hear from you.
