I am in the process of setting up a conference call with my contact here as
Well as victor burke. Prelimainary indications are they have not finalized
Their objectives yet but I will discuss that further with them. I would
Still strongly suggest rescheduling until everyone can attend and we can
Fully discuss our involvement.

I have discussed with aa and they are following up. If I am the agenda, i
Would cancel the meeting and when I hear from aa, I will e mail everyone. I
Would suggest we not hold a meeting until kean, buy, koenig and I can all
Come so that we can truly move forward (or decide not to). Let me know what
You decide. Thanks. Rick
