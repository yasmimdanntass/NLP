Subject: a chapter to be published in a book by clewlow/strickland
Darrell,
Grant masson, ronnie chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
On energy derivatives to be published soon in australia (a book by
Clewlow and strickland).
Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is
Less
Than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
Embarrassing errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could
Take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same
Arrangement as in the previous cases).
Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the
Next few days to update you on our work and developments at enron.
Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look
For work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
No economic sense. He spent the summer building his
Own computer (1000 mhz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker
Toiling under his management.
I hope everything is well at home and that your wife' s company is doing great.
Regards.
Vince
