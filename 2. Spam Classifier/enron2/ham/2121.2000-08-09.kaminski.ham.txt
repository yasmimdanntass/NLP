Subject: re: houston research opportunity
Tara:
Thanks for the update. It seems anjam is playing hard ball a little. My
Initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer, but on
Second thoughts, could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a
12 - month assignment when you have a moment? Compensation, benefits,
Responsibilities, career path implications, etc.
Many thanks!
Regards,
Grant.
