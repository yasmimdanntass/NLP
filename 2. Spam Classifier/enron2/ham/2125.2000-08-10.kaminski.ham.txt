Subject: risk bucketing for p/l
Ken and greg,
What we have been doing is absoutely fine under the assumption that the market
Conditions move relatively small (where taylor series has fast convergence).
However, we could run into troubles when the market has a big move.
In order to have a error proof bucketing, we can use the following
Method (finite - difference), let me
Know what you guys think how to implement it to the transport book.
Sensitivity to risk parameters, or p/l attribution by risk bucket:
Today' s premium = premium based on today' s curves
Last day' s premium = premium based on last day' s curves
Change due to
Deliverycurveshift = [premium based on today' s delivery price and last day' s
Receipt price, volatilities, interest rate, last' s time to expiration etc] -
Last day' s premium - today' s change due to gammal
Receiptcurveshift = [premium based on today' s receipt price and last day' s
Everything else] - last day' s premium - today' s change due to gamma 2
Vegal = [premium based on today' s delivery volatility and last day' s
Everything else] - last day' s premium
Vega 2 = as above for gas volatility
Rho = as above for interest rate
Eta = as above for correlation
Theta = {[premium based on today' s days to expiration and last day' s
Everything else] - drift - last day' s premium}/365. 25
[this is a daily theta. The sprdopt function returns an annualised theta.]
Gammal = 0. 5 last day' s gammal' * priceshiftl 2?? Gamma 2 = 0. 5 last day' s gamma 2' * priceshift 2 2
Drift = [(exp (last day' s interest rate * (today - last days)/365. 25)) - 1] *
Last day' s premium
Priceshiftl = today' s delivery price - last day' s delivery price
Priceshift 2 = today' s receipt price - last day' s receipt price
Gammal' = theoretical gammal, i. E. Gamma from spread option
Gamma 2' = theoretical gamma 2, i. E. Gamma from spread option calculation
Liquidation = premium of option which expired the day before, i. E. Intrinsic
Value.
