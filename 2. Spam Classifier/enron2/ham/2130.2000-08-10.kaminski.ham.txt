Subject: yesterday
I enjoyed meeting you both yesterday to discuss my sincere interest in the
Research group.
Since many of the rotations for analysts are pre - determined, I think it is
Best for me to wait until my candidacy
For the analyst program is finalized.
Thank you for your interest in my skill - set. I am enrolled in the cfa
Program, have completed numerous futures/options
Courses in undergraduate school, and am confident that my profile will be
Well - received after completing your in - house
Project which will be utilized to test certain skills.
I' ll talk to you soon after my discussions with the analyst program.
Regards,
David
