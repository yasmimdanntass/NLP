Subject: research dept. Move
Hello everyone:
Attached is the churn relocation request for some office exchanges within
The research group on the 19 th floor. I have grouped them in sets of two
Which are the exchanges.
This is a very rush order. We would appreciate your getting to this as
Soon as possible - the 15 th of august would be great, if possible.
Let me know if there is something that you do not understand. Thanks!
Shirley
