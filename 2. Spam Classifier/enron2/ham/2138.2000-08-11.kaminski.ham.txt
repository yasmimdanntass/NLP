Subject: 2000 chairman' s award
Everyday heroes are all around us at enron, living our core values of
Respect, integrity, communication and excellence in everything they do. Some
Of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference
In the workplace around them. Either way, these special individuals deserve
To be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 chairman' s award.
As there is more than just one employee living the values at enron, this
Award program will honor 10 employees as members of the chairman' s
Roundtable. From that group, the one individual most embodying our values
Will be presented with the chairman' s award at the management conference in
San antonio in november.
The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee - driven
From beginning to end. From your nominations, an international employee
Committee will select the chairman' s roundtable and eventually, the
Chairman' s award winner. Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is
Extremely vital to the program' s success. If someone has made a positive
Impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and
Send it to charla reese by october 1, 2000. You may click here for a
