Subject: summer internship
Hi,
I' d like to thank you for the opportunity of letting me work here this
Summer. I' ve learned a lot in the past three months and hopefully have been
Of some help around here. I was very impressed with this department, and
Enron itself, and I really appreciate the chance for me to have worked in
Such an environment.
So anyway, thank you and I wish you and the department well,
Brad
