Vince,
Today is the last day of my internship here this summer. I have had a
Terrific summer. Thank you so much for all of your support! I have talked
With my supervisor from this group and I am pleased that he feels strongly
And positively about my performance. Of course, my job decision is a very
Important one for me and as I consider job offers in the upcoming months, a
Variety of factors will be influencing my choice. Certainly one of them will
Be the positive experiece I have had with enron. But regardless of my
Decision in future, I am so glad that I have had the opportunity to glimpse
Into enron' s business and culture. I have met some amazing people here, and
My experience with enron is something I will always take with me whereever i
Go.
I hope to hear from you again. Please feel free to contact me at any time.
My email remains: vngo@ rice. Edu and I will leave shirley my phone number as
Soon as I know it!
Deepest regards,
Van
