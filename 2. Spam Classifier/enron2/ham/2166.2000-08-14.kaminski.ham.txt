Subject: thank you
Dear dr. Kaminsky:
I want to thank you for interviewing me last friday and inviting me back for
A follow - up interview. It was a pleasure to meet you and other members of
Your staff.
My interest in working for enron research was strengthened as a result of the
Interview. I was most impressed by the quality and diversity of talents
Within your group. My proficiency in probabilistic analysis and experience in
Engineering and financial risk management fit nicely with the activities of
Your group. I have a demonstrated ability to adapt my skills with changing
Business needs. As a member of shell research, I supported internal clients
From different business units. I am confident that I could make a significant
Contribution to your organization over time.
I want to reiterate my strong interest in working with you and your staff.
You provide the kind of opportunity I seek. I look forward to seeing you
Again on my follow - up interview next week. Again, thank you for the interview
And your consideration.
Sincerely,
RabI s. De
