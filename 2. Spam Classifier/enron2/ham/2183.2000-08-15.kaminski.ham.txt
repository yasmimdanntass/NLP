Vince,
Thank you so much for forwarding this information to me as well as making
Some initial contacts on campus! I was wondering if you could provide a two
Hour time slot in the next two weeks for the cal berkeley planning session
With the entire campus team here in the office? I would like to get the
Entire team together prior to the career fair on the 8 th so that we can go
Over the strategy, dates on campus, and roles/responsibilities.
Also, I know that you mentioned that the first couple of weeks in october
Would be the best to target for the general information session. How does
The week of october 9 th look for you? Is there a certain day that works the
Best? I would like to work with your schedule to see if we can come up with
A date in that timeframe.
Thanks again for your help!
Ashley
