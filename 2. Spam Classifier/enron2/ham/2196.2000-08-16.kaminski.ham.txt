Subject: re: agenda for thursday' s meeting
Hello all,
I look forward to this meeting. Since the time vince and I last spoke, we
Have really gained some traction in this area of improving our relationships
With universities. I am going to take the liberty of inviting mike rosen to
The meeting. Mike has done a great job on several relationship - based special
Projects, and i' d like to hear his thoughts as we develop the angles of this
Initiative.
See you tomorrow,
Mark
