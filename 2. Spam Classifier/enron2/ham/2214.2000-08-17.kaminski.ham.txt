Subject: interview
Vince,
We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our
Schedules. I will be back in houston next week (august 21 st), and would
Appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice.
As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities
That are more us focused. I think paula corey has already forwarded my
Resume to you. However, I have attached it to this note just in case.
I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and
Would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your
Schedule. I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Rahul
