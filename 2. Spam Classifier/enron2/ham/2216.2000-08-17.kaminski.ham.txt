Vince, would it be possible for me to work with whomever is designing this
Mug to see if we could incorporate the enron logo into the design? I agree
With mark that it would be preferable to have the logo somewhere on this.
Please let me know.
Marge, ext. 36631

Looks a little off - brand to me. Do you think we need an enron logo? Can you
Help vince? Anything from the catalog they could personalize?

Rice univ. Wants to produce a coffee mug for the participants of the workshop
Enron sponsors.
Please, take a look at the proposed design. Do we need any formal approval?

Vince:
I have attached the general design we are proposing for the enron seminar
Series mug. We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
Couple type - o' s but this is the idea. If you like it, we will put an order
In.
I' ll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly. So far the
Fall line up includes will goetzman - yale, lenard mirman - virgina, jeff
Pontiff - u. Of washington, george allyannis - darden, and charles lee -
Cornell.
Thank you.
