Dear dr. Kaminski
I am sorry I missed your phone call today. I was waiting for your call until
7: 50 am (australia time) this morning. My mother - in - law told me you ringed
Me at 8: 05. I guess we made a mistake at the time difference. I promise i
Won' t leave home tomorrow until I receive your call.
Your faithfully
Quentin
