Comments:
1. In the sentence between eqn. 3 and eqn. 4, I think" annualized
Volatility" should replace" annualized standard deviation."
2. As to the comment," immediately we see something quite
Counter - intuitive." I would disagree. I think that its quite intuitive
That this model should get closer to the black - scholes price as what is
Defined as the" jump" component becomes just part of the main price
Distribution, which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1 - sigma
Event. The table does show, however, that the results of using this model
Are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a" jump" (i. E. 2 - sigma
Or 3 - sigma... Events), and this is one difficulty in using the model in
Practice.
3. In the paragraph after the table, I don' t understand the argument about
Hedging the option. Especially about buying a swap which would pay on the
Difference between the strike and fs. This seems non - sensical.
4. I could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article, so
This point should probably be explained more clearly.
