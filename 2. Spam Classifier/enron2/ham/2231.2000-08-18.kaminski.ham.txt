Wicke,
Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to houston
Yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for london, and then poland. I
Will most likely be at the olympics in sydney in late september, and in ny
In early october. Mid - october could be the first realistic opportunity to
Visit with enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in palo
Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
Competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
Developing.
I am senior vice president for visa usa, responsible for strategy and
Planning. I would probably bring with me (though I haven' t discuss it yet)
People in charge of our network or/and our coo.
Best,
Andrzej

When you plan to visit houston. Also, the information about
Your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
About the other members of your team) would be useful.
