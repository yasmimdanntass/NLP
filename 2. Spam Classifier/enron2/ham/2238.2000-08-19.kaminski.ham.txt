Dear vince,
Back in july, when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
Theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application
Of extreme value theory to power and esp. To weather. In a recent news
Article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max, t _ min,
Etc.
I am in particular referring to the news article below:
In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
T _ max, t _ min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
Past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in
Particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of evt could
Provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.
Has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather? Evt has
A long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts
Of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. At eth in zuerich)
Is indicating the application of evt to v@ r....
Thank you!
Regards,
Christian
