Subject: long - term volatility curves
Grant,
Can research in houston put together a comparison of the long - term volatility
Curves for gas and power in north america and europe? Based on where europe
Is marked (especially for the uk), I think we' ll find a significant
Difference out beyond 10 years. Fundamentally, it seems like the long - term
Vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.
Has research done any work on this in the past? If not, we should study this
Since long - term vol feeds into the var - based position limits.
Give me a call so we can discuss.
Thanks
Dale
