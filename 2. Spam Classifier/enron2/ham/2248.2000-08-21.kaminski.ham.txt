Vince,
Thanks for your response. Apparently, we were under the incorrect impression
That your group would be taking lI (based on jeff' s note below). We
Apologize for not contacting you last friday to confirm prior to" placing" li
In your group. I have faxed li' s resume to you and hope that you will have
Time to review it today. Please call me back as soon as you can to discuss
Li' s opportunities in your group.
If vince is not interested in lI for his group, we will consider lI placed in
Ena - gas trading (original placement) in john lavorato' s organization. Once
I hear from vince one way or the other, the program will consider li' s
Placement final in either research or ena - gas trading. Hopefully this will
Be resolved by tuesday morning so that we may communicate to lI her rotation
Information. If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thank you!

Shelly,
I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.
LI was scheduled to meet with me last thursday but she never showed
Up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume.
Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Shelly,
Hunter spoke with lI today and agrees that her first rotation should be in
Vince' s group doing modelling, etc. This will give her the broadest
Experience for a first rotation. I' m sure the other person in question,
Vikas, will do very well in hunter' s group.
Thanks for your help.
Jeff
