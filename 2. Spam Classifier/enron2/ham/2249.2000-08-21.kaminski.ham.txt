Subject: colored printer taj mahal
Hello everyone.
This memo only applies to the research group on the 19 th floor that use
The colored printer" taj mahal".
Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer
" taj mahal" for presentations, newsletters, etc. That require at least 90%
Of color. These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
Picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
Would be maybe 15 - 20 pages long. This is not cost effective.
If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest
Of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color
Printer
And the rest on" bandit" or" wagon".
Your help will be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Shirley
