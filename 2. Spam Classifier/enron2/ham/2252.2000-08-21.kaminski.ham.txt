Subject: tff 2001 meeting date question
Hello from texas,
We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run
Into a snag. We cannot get our san antonio hotel on the first weekend in
April (as last year). However, we can get the hotel and make all our" fun"
Arrangements for the second weekend in april. However, this is easter
Weekend. The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower
Because it' s a holiday. However, we are concerned that holding the meeting
On this particular friday - saturday will interfere with family plans such that
Some or many of you may not be able to attend.
My related question to you is this:
Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in april (easter weekend) pose
A problem for you? Please give us your thoughts asap even if you think you
May not be able to attend this year' s conference. We need your opinion to
Guide our decision.
Thanks and I hope to see you all again next april (sometime)!
John
P. S. We are very fortunate to have enron return as our corporate sponsor
Again this year.
