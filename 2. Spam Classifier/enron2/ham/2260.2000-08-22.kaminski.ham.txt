Michael
I have got csfb working on the amendment you asked for.
In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market
Values of the water companies and the rab of the industry since
Privatisation. The following points come out
1 market values overtime have been 1. 1 x rab
2 the result is significantly skewed by the period between mid 1997 and end
1998 when the ratio was cl. 5 x.
3 the premium to rab is only found at a time when political uncertainty has
Been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal
Significantly. Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in
Share prices in the last year
Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of
Water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the rab market
Value ratio is a straight average. Obviously that influences the numbers a
Little.
On customerco. Csfb have contacted around 7 energy companies. The result
Has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise. I
Await a revised fee proposal but csfb have been advised that it should be
More modest than the last one!
