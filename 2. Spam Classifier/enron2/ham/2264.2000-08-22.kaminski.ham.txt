Subject: seeking intelligent insight
It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy
Iron within the next several years. The structure is still very early in its
Development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for enron in
Bandwidth and electricity. I would be interested to know what issues you two
Would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.
If you would like, please feel free to comment on the attached documents.
Thanks,
