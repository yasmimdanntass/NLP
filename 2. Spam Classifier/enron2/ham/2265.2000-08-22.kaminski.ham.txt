Subject: lI sun
I' ve asked vince to get involved with you about getting lI into vince' s
Group. This issue needs to be resolved by week' s end - - we look like we don' t
Have our act together, and that bothers me. Especially since we are about to
Make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new
Wharton recruit disgruntled.
Vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up
With our meeting with skilling? Thanks very much...
Jeff
