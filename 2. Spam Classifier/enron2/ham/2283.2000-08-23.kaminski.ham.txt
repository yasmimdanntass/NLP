Subject: re: tff 2001 meeting date question
Vince,
I certainly understand. However, we are going to try to move the date up a
Week or two to make sure there are no conflicts for anyone. We' ve had some
Trouble getting our hotel date even this far in advance. I' ll be back in
Touch when we get it ironed out.
