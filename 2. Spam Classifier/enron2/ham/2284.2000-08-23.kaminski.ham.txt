Vince:
I understand that you are the lead recruiter for cmu. As you know, I am the
Only alum from that school in enron' s associate program. I assume I will be
Joining you for our corporate presentation on 9/13 at 7: 30 am. Please let me
Know what I can do to help prepare for this event. Enron and gsia are a
Great fit, so I want this recruiting effort to go well.
Are you also giving a talk/lecture to the computational finance students? If
So, what time? Maybe we can schedule a lunch with duane seppi. I look
Forward to hearing from you.
John gordon
