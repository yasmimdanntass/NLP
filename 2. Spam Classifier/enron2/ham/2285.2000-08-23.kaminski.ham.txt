Dear vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven' t heard from you about the
Date of your visit. Our department has a seminar every monday. If you can
Schedule your visit on a monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
Which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
Give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
Lead - time I can advertise the seminar in the hass school to their financial
Engineering students.
Shmuel.
