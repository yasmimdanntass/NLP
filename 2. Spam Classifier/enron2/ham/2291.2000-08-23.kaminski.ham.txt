Jeff,
I met with lI sun last night and I shall take her for the first rotation.
She comes across as a very smart and highly motivated person.
I am planning to go with mark palmer to wharton in october to
Finalize the deal.

I' ve asked vince to get involved with you about getting lI into vince' s
Group. This issue needs to be resolved by week' s end - - we look like we don' t
Have our act together, and that bothers me. Especially since we are about to
Make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new
Wharton recruit disgruntled.
Vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up
With our meeting with skilling? Thanks very much...
Jeff
