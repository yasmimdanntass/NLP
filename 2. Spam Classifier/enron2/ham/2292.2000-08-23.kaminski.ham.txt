Subject: martin lin
Norma,
Thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for martin
Lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for
Him. As I mentioned during our meeting, just my small team within research
Has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years, and we have had a hard time
Recruiting good candidates. Last year we made an offer to a person
Graduating from ut (ms in computational finance) of 75 k plus 25 k signing
Bonus. He replied that he would like to work at enron but was already in
The position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $100 k.
Martin is a very skilled individual with a ph. D. In electrical engineering
And almost two years experience at enron. He would be very difficult (and
Expensive) to replace. For this reason I feel it necessary to be proactive
In finding ways of retaining him as an employee.
Please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1 - year
Retention bonus of 10 k and a raise to 87 k base salary for mr. Lin. I would
Plan to then give martin an additional raise at his next review period.
Regards,
Stinson
