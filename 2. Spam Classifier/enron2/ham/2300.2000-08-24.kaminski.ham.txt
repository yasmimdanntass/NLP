Vince,
Thanks for responding to christian. I had replied earlier and said that evt
Is based on iid events, and is therefore not useful in weather, where there
Is so much correlation going on. Jitendra from aa raised the same issue
Yesterday.

Christian,
About two years ago I asked joe hrgovcic
To look tinto evt applications. As far as I know
He is the only person in the group, in addition to me, looking at evt.

Dear vince,
Back in july, when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
Theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application
Of extreme value theory to power and esp. To weather. In a recent news
Article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max, t _ min,
Etc.
I am in particular referring to the news article below:
In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
T _ max, t _ min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
Past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in
Particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of evt could
Provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.
Has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather? Evt has
A long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts
Of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. At eth in zuerich)
Is indicating the application of evt to v@ r....
Thank you!
Regards,
Christian
