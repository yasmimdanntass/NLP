The ees/ibm it team would again like to thank all of you for your vigorous
Participation in last weeks it needs analysis workshop. In particular, we
Would like to extend appreciation to jay, dave roberts, and dennis for their
Business presentations. Thanks, as well, to meghan corley, barry
Vanderhorst, burt bailey, and glenn dickson for presenting their individual
Area needs, to meredith for overall assistance in creating and delivering the
Agenda, and to marty for his sponsorship and support.
The team is currently assimilating the results and formulating an action plan
To address priority 1, 2, and 3 needs. Actions to address many priority 1
Items are underway. We will be reporting on this in marty' s weekly staff
Meeting.
Attached below are the results from the meeting, as well as copies of all
Materials that were presented. Any additional feedback is welcome and
Encouraged.
Apologies to any participants that do not appear on this distribution. One
Thing we failed to do was to take an attendees list. Please forward to your
Team mates, accordingly.
Thank you,
Maureen craig and john krakoski
