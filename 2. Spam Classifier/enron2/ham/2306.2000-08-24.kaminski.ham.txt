Hullo, vince:
I hope you' re very well. As you can see, I am now working for the ft' s
Magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what' s currently
Termed
The expatriate division and i' ve just passed my statutory probationary period
Of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew
You' d hear from me sooner or later, especially when I need help! Having
Gotten
Thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects...... I' m investigating
Several
Ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
One of them.
Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international
Private investor, specifically
O hnwis
O owner - managers
O results - oriented but intelligent investor with long - term investment goals
And
A desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on
Something approaching equal terms
The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
Private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
Themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including
The" wilder shores" such as hedge funds and emerging markets. I am working on
A
Portal site (imaginatively entitled ftexpat. Com!), nested within ft. Com, which
Will launch in october; international investment will be a significant channel
On the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future)
Offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion
Of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other
Contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know
It' s
Not bang in your sphere but i' m hoping you' ll be interested enough to share
Your thoughts with me.
If you can give me a few pointers, i' d be grateful. Looking forward to hearing
From you,
Sh? N
