Naveen,
Most of these tests have been already coded. The code and the associated
Spreadsheets may have been lost inn the sands of time. Please, check with
Vasant: it may save you some time.

Subject: backtesting
Vince,
I am currently implementing the backtesting features into our
Risk management system. I distributed the following document at our research
Meeting today; it outlines the conventional binomial test and some other
Tests, including the basle regulatory test. Of course, no one test is
Powerful and the efficacy of these tests breakdown for low sample sizes,
Etc. If you can think of other tests to complement these, please let me know.
Regards
Naveen
