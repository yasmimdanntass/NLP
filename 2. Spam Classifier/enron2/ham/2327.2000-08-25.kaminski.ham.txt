We have been working the last few days to get ena' s united way participation
Rate up as high as possible. I called earlier about your cost center because
The following 16 employees were listed in power trading, but I believe are
Part of the research organization.
If you have a chance, could you encourage them to log onto
Http:// unitedway. Enron. Com on the intranet and make a contribution to the
United way. The deadline is today.
Thanks.
Eric
