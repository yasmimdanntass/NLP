Subject: floating lng terminal
Folks,
As a follow - up to scott neal' s inquiry this morning concerning
Portable/floating lng opportunities for california, I have learned that no
Such capability currently exists.
According to todd peterson of enron global lng, exploitation of this
Opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far
As we know, has
Constructed such a vessel.
I did come across a proposed design for an lng floating terminal by the
Italian company, tecnomare. I contacted them and they indicated that they
Have not
Built such a vessel. It is estimated that construction of such a vessel
Would take 2 - 3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required
Operational and
Environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
Please let me know if any further research is needed.
