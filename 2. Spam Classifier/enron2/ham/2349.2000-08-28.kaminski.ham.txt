Unfortunately I do not have a phone right now so I will have to call as soon
As they get me up and running. I went ahead and sent out the dates we have
On schedule currently with the intention that if we get new dates they will
Be announced in the team meeting on thursday. Hope that is okay. I needed
To get a message out to participant soon so we don' t get in a bind in a
Couple of weeks.
