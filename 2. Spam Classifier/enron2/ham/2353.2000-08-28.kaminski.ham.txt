Subject: research group
Hello norma:
In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information.
There is one thing you probably need to be aware of. On the research
List, elena chilkina is shown as an analyst p/t, however, in the records she
Is shown as an" adm coord". This was done so that she could be considered
Non - exempt and receive overtime. However, her actual job is an analyst.
Also, roman zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
Ago, but was never moved to the new group. He is now up for rotation again
And vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation.
If you have any questions, please call me.
