Chris,
My part has not changed for some time (since early july).
I sent the last vintage of corrections to you when I was in sydney.
You can send the version you consider final to us just to double check.
I took the liberty of sending our chapter to darrell duffie and he liked it.
What is more important he did not find any error.
I shell send you my comments on the article for robin in a day or so.

HI vince,
?
How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have the latest version of your
Part of chapter 3? (I think grant has sent thru a seperate, updated version
To you, which has been typeset). Everything else has been tied up and we
Will go with the version we have, unless we hear otherwise.
?
Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.
