HI vince,

How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have the latest version of your
Part of chapter 3? (I think grant has sent thru a seperate, updated version
To you, which has been typeset). Everything else has been tied up and we
Will go with the version we have, unless we hear otherwise.

Many thanks and best regards.
