Jeff,
I don' t think this transaction makes sense. We should not keep increasing our
Exposure
In one area, given that we can deploy our capital in a more efficient way
Elsewhere,
Without taking illiquid, long - term positions.

This is a draft of the dash we are putting together. Michael tribolet works
In my group and feel free to contact him if you have specific questions. I
Also spoke with frevert re lng and he informed me that if project summer
Happpens, lng goes with summer, if not, it is transferred to you. What
Happens in the mean time is anyone' s guess. Lets discuss. Rick

Here is the draft of the dash. While having a positive npv, many of the
Trials run are negative due to defaults.
