HI vince, stinson
Thank you for hosting my visit to enron and arranging for me to meet
With you and other decision - makers at enron. The meetings been very
Productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
Clearly.
We are entering the period that I have to set up the research assistantships
(ra)
For next year for giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
On this project. School starts in late september, but already I have to
Start putting together the papers for the ras in the fall, as per departmental
Requirement.
Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
Do the raship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
Pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these raships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of september,
Just before school starts.
I am attaching below the same draft of a letter I had sent you in a previous
E - mail, which would be required to set up the project at stanford. Please,
Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive
Collaboration
During the coming year and beyond.
Best regards,
Nick
Ps: vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the bay area
