Subject: lng meeting
Vince,
Before I contact the london staff about next wednesday' s meeting, I was
Wondering if we could move it up a little bit. The reason is that by 2 pm in
Houston it is 8 pm in london and I thought it might be difficult to round up
The crew in london at that time. Please let me know if we have plans to
Change the time.
Thanks,
Eric
