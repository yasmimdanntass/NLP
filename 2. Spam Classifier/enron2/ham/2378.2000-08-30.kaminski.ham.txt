Subject: transport fuel p/l
Colleen,
After looking into the transport deals for nbpl (long term deal 1, 2, 25, 26),
I think I figured it out why
We see positive fuel p/l for deal 1, 25, and 26 and negative fuel p/l for deal
2.
The following plot shows nymex curve as of 8/23/00:
For short term, nymex moved up compared to that of 8/22/00, while the long
Term nymex moved down.
Here are the tenor for each deal:
Deal 1: start 01 - sep - 00, end 22 - may - 09, the above graph suggested a
Positve fuel p/l
Deal 2: start 01 - sep - 00, end 28 - feb - 02, the above graph suggested a
Small negative p/l
Deal 25: start 01 - may - 02, end 28 - feb - 09, the above graph suggested a
Positve fuel p/l
Deal 26: start 01 - mar - 09, end 31 - may - 09, the above graph suggested a
Positve fuel p/l
The transport book seems to be correct on these fuel p/ls.
Another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index
Price (nymex + basis + index premium), to correctly interpret fuel p/l,
We need to look at the index curve change.
Let me know your thoughts on this.
