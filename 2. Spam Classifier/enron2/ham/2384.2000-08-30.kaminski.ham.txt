Dale,
Thanks for your message.
I don' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
For quants is very hot. Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
And I would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company.
I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
O 62, 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently (if I remember
Correctly). Steve has a much higher value
To enron than anjam.
