Natural gas markets in mexico
Natural gas demand in mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8%
Annually. Such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 bcf
Per day, according to government forecasts. In response, pemex proposes two
Actions: the first consists of measures to increase cross - border pipeline
Infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by coral
Energy into pemex' s supply hub at reynosa. The possibility of a new
Pipeline to monterrey is still an option. A second measure is to implement
A gas - centric exploration and production program focused on five areas, two
Of which are dry natural gas basins, burgos and macuspana. This second
Measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80%. At present,
Pemex' s 10 - year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
Production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance.
