I trust things are well in houston.
The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the
Week
Commencing monday 18 th september. I and several of my colleagues would very
Much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference
Between tuesday through to friday of that week.
Is there any chance in meeting with you on monday 18 th? If so, I will brief
You
More fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.
Regards, allan
