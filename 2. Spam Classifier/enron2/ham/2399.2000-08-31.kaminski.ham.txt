Per my voice mail to vince, martin lins offer letter will be provided to him
On thursday, august 31, 2000.
However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally
Discussed. Therefore, based on his phd and market information we are able to
Offer him a base salary of 98 - 100 k and no retention bonus. We can discuss
Retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.
If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me. Otherwise,
Please approve salary structure of base 98, 000 with no bonus.
Thank you.
