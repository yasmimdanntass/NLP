HI vince,
I just got off the phone with donna piazze at wharton, (I don' t know if there
Is a relationship with tom at wharton), and we were discussing there tiger
Teams. It is a required research program, 2 nd semester for mbas, and wharton
Would love to have enron participate. I told her there is probably some real
Life reasearch project we could have the students do. She did also mention
That it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton.. I
Gave her your number.
Her number is 215 573 8394. Please call her when you get a chance within the
Week.
Mark, can we get christy involved? Thanks everyone.
Jeff
