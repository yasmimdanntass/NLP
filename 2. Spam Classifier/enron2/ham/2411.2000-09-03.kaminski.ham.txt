Subject: request for natural gas technical analysis
Hello mike,
I work in rodney malcolm' s commercial transaction group, focusing on
Developing energy management relationships with large volume industrial
Energy consumers. Due to the volatility and high price levels of the natural
Gas contract, these consumers of natural gas are extremely concerned about
This exposure, and they are asking for our assistance in helping them manage
This exposure. One of the tools that these customers are requesting is
Technical analysis of the natural gas contract so as to determine entry
Points for their hedges.
To the extent you could assist us with this analysis, we can proactively
Meet these customer requests and increase our deal flow.
Please advise as to the availability of your assistance.
Thank you, tim
