Both,
Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.
Based on your comments here would be my proposal
O 63, 500 basic salary -
Ol 5 k kickers for each of the 2 years - these are paid as a lump sum on each
Anniversary guaranteed. Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o 78, 500 -
This is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o 60 k to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a
1/3 ($20, 000) hanging out there at the end of the contract.
Just fyI - anjam is currently on o 68, 000 but does not have an agreement, so
This would effectively put a 10. 5 k gap between the two.
Let me know your thoughts.

Bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,
Thanks for your message.
I don' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
For quants is very hot. Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
And I would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company.
I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
O 62, 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently (if I remember
Correctly). Steve has a much higher value
To enron than anjam.
