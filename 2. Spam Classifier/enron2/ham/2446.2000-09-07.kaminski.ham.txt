Michael - we have a contract with weatherwise to launch the weatherproof bill
Here in our service territory. The wpb is a hedge for customers and, to some
Extent, a weather hedge for us. We are not buying a typical enron - like hedge
From them, however.
If you want me to talk to ronnie i' d be glad to.

An associate of mine from research, ronnie chahal, is working for the enron
Subsidiary newpower and was wondering if pge uses weatherwise, a derivatives
Provider for weather hedges among other things. Ronnie is trying to get some
Background on them. If any of you know whether pge uses this service, please
Contact ronnie or me and let me know to whom ronnie could speak about pge' s
Experiences with weatherwise.
Thanks,
Michael
