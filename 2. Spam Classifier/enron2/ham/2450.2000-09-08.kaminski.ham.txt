Dear vince,
The following message is from co - pi, prof. Baichun xiao in long island
University.
In this message, he told me how enron would be registered. To my best
Knowledge,
Ibm, lucent and other big companies have registered in nsf for long.
Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much.
Good weekend,
Youyi

Dear youyi:
The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
Nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.
Fastlane user support: 1 - 800 - 673 - 6188.
Fastlane availability (recording): 1 - 800 - 437 - 7408.
After enron is registered (I think it' s a free registration), you provide
The following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
Nsf will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
Fastlane after oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.
Name
Highest degree
Year conferred
Present institution
Department
Street address
City
State
Zip code
Social security number (ssn)
Email address
Business phone number
Business fax number
For more information, you may go to
