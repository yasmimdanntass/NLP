Pierre - philippe,
Thanks for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation in early
November. I understand the presentation are on fridays and november the 3 rd
Would be the best date for me.
If you prefer november the 10 th, we have to wait a few more days with the
Decision. We have a management conference every year in san antonio and it
Will be held either in the 2 nd or the 3 rd week of november. I shall know in a
Few days. The same goes for november 9, assuming it was not a mistake (it' s
Thursday).
I shall be free for dinner on the day of the conference. Thanks for the
Invitation.
Vince
