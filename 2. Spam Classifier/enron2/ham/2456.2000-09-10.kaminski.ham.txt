Dear professor shreve,
Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation at
Carnegie mellon. I am discussing with pierre ste - marie possible dates and it
Seems at this point that november the 3 rd would be the most convenient day.
November the 10 th is an alternative date, but I need a few more days to make
A commitment.
Look forward to meeting you.
