Subject: re: anjam' s term sheet
Tara:
I am forwarding it to vince for his approval. It looks good although I have
Three questions:
1) I presume that it is clear that enron pays housing up to 1500/month.
Anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with. Utility bills are not
Included unless part of the rent, right? This should be clarified; as you
Know, houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket - book.
2) economy class plane. Can we even do that? I thought enron policy was for
A b - class ticket for flights over 6 hours.
3) 500 lbs of transport. I don' t know if this is a big ticket item, but i
Would give him less, 250 say, if it would save enron considerable expense.
Regards,
Grant.
