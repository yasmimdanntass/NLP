What do you want to do? My experience tells me that it' s not about the
Money. His wife doesn' t want to move.

Toni,
I spoke with ben this morning and he is asking me what he should do. He
Knows how good the opportunity is
And this is something he really wants to do. However, his wife is having a
Hard time making the commitment. Although he says she is not totally against
It, she is obviously not 100% sold. Ben feels bad about keeping vince,
Grant, and other potential team members at enron waiting. He does not want
To lose the opportunity, yet he needs some help in convincing his wife. I am
Open for suggestions. Is this somebody you really want and if so what can
We do get him?
Thanks,
Mike
