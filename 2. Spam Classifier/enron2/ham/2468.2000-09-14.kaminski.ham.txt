Subject: update on ut - enron activities: my conversation with rick causey
Vince,
Good morning.
As you may know, last thur. Enron honored this year' s recipients of the
Enron mba excellence fund scholars at a dinner in austin. In addition to
The three recipients, business school dean may and several of my
Colleagues, enron attendees included sally beck, cindy justice, karen
Marshall (newly - appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives for
Enron community relations dept.) and rick causey.
I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
Current enron/ut issues with rick:
I. Spring 2001 conference participation by jeffrey k. Skilling
Ii. Ut participation in enrontraining activities
Per my conversation with rick last thur., I followed up on that discussion
With an e - mail this morn that touched on those two topics.
I. With respect to the first, I wrote rick this morning that:
1. We at the ut center for energy finance education and research (cefer)
Are planning a practitioner - industry conference in spring 2001 (late feb.
Or early march) to discuss four topics: risk management, deregulation,
Real options, and international/globalization.
2. The conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address thur.
Evening, then continue all day fri.
3. I have had several discussions with you regarding conference timing,
Structure, participation and content.
4. Further to rick' s agreement to do so during our discussion last thur.,
In today' s e - mail I asked rick to extend an invitation to jeff skilling to
Be the keynote speaker at the thur. Evening dinner.
Ii. With respect to the second topic, rick and I also discussed ut
Partcipation in enron corp. Internal training for incoming enron corp.
Analysts and associates. Consequently, I e - mailed rick this morning a
Specific set of issues - -" valuation and risk management in energy markets"
- - which my ut colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
Customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
Presentation at enron. Fyi, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
End of this e - mail.
I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your ut visit on 10/11. Best,
Ehud
