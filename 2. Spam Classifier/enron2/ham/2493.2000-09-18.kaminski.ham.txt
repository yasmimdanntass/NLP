Subject: thanks
Dear mr. Masson:
Thank you very much for offering me an opportunity to work in your group.
However because of family reasons, I have to regrettably inform you that i
Will not be able to make the move at this time. It has been a great
Experience working with you on this process, and I greatly appreciate your
Help.
I realized that this would have been a great opportunity for me, and I thank
You very much for everything. I hope you will still consider me for a
Position in the future.
Sincerely,
Ben
