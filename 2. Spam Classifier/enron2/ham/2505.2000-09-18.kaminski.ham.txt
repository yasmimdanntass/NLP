Fyi, I do not send out a written offer package until the verbal offer issues
Are resolved and a final offer is made. So, i' d like to put the details
Below in writing and send out to him for tuesday delivery. I' m playing
Phone tag with him regarding the other details and will follow up with him
Again in the morning.
Thanks
Toni

Toni:
We talked to rabi. He' s sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he
Has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a
Lower level but has more potential. Wrt the green, vince verbally offered
Salary of $105 k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a
Minimum of $15 k cash. That' s in addition to the $15 k sign on bonus. Vince
Said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and
Until rabI came back with a verbal ok. He will ponder the offer; probably
For a few more days and get back with us. He may well call you to discuss
The exact details of the benefits. Esop, 401 (k) contributions, etc.
Regards,
Grant.
