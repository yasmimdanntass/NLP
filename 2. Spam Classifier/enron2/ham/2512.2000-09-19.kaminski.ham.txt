Subject: re: part - time work
Vince,
Zimin and I talked briefly about the part - time work this morning. To recap;
I am willing to work 20 hours a week, however, I expressed my concern about
Commuting every week. I asked if commuting once every two weeks (and work
Out of austin every other week) would be acceptable. As to the term of the
Work, I suggested a 3 - mo period (I have yet not talked to international
Office which arranges work authorization using curricular practical training
Of which I have used up 9 months already), I might run into problems if i
Ask for more. I also mentioned that I would do my best to accomodate your
Preferences. We did not discuss any other details.
I shall be awaiting for your response on this matter.
Best,
