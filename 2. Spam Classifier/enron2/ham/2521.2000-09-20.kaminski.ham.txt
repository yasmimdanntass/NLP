Zimin,
Andrea reed asked for our help in looking for end - users of steel which might
Be used to take a commodity hedge position. She will work on identifying
Potential equities or indices which might be used, and then we will analyze
Them for correlation or co - integration with steel prices. Andrea should be
Contacting you next week regarding the project. Hector has done
Co - integration analysis in the past and has the tools to do this project.
Thanks,
Stinson

Should be used in this analysis.
