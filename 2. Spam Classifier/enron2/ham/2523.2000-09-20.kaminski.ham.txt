Subject: sacramento weather station
Hey guys,
We' re talking to a contractor (s) that can build us a weather station
(hopefully very quickly) for placement in sacramento, california. For a
Variety of legal, contractor, and operational reasons, I need to confirm some
Of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed:
A) you need rainfall, snowfall, and temperature measurement from one,
High - accuracy commercially available weather station.
B) you need a daily feed of this data to enron' s weather desk: does this
Mean one data dump at a set time per day? Alternatively, will you need to
Check the data real - time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the
Day?
C) we will be installing this station near sacramento, california: we will
Need to know exactly what areas in/near sacramento are suitable for the site
Of the weather station. (what again was the name of the town that you
Mentioned mark?) in the interest of time, I recommend that your weather
Expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman
To more quickly lease and install the station.
D) you desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect
Tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install
The station and then develop security measures.
E) we will feed the data directly to the enron weather desk. Will any other
Parties require real - time access to this data?
Please forward responses directly to: chris clark/na/enron and myself.
Thanks, scott
