Steve,
I am a lead recruiter at the university of california at berkeley for
Enron analyst/associate program.
I contacted several friends who work at berkeley and received an invitation
From one of them to make a presentation at the weekly faculty seminar
Of the dept. Of industrial engineering and operations research.
The students and faculty members from the business school will be also
Invited.
Berkeley in general, and department of industrial engineering and operations
Research in
Particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(s. Oren works very closely with severin borenstein).
My presentation will focus on the analyst/associate program. I shall also
Have
An opportunity to discuss the power markets in california (I expect many
Questions) before many experts who are very important to shaping
Public opinion and regulatory agenda.
Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this
Presentation
And in presenting enron' s point of view in a more effective way.
Vince
