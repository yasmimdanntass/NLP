Subject: university of texas conference on energy finance, february 2001
Jeff,
Our friends at the university of texas are planning a conference on energy
Economics and finance in february of next year. They would like very much to
Have
You as a keynote speaker.
Given our good, long - term relationship with ut, I would recommend
That you speak at this conference. I talked to prof. Ehud ronn
A few times about the program and I think that this will be
An excellent forum to present enron' s accomplishments and
Agenda for the future.
I am sure that rick causey will join me in making the same recommendation.
