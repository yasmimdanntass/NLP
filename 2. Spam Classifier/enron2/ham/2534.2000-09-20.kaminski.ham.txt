Subject: spring 2001 conference participation by jeffrey k. Skilling
Rick/vince,
Good morning.
In my 9/14 e - mail, I advised you of the practitioner - industry cefer (center
For energy finance education and research) conference we are planning for
Spring 2001. As you know, we would like to invite jeff skilling to be the
Keynote speaker at the thur. Evening dinner. The following day' s four
Topics consist of risk management, deregulation, real options, and
International/globalization. The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly u. S. - based) energy - industry practitioners, as well as
Several academics.
Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for feb. 22, 2001. Could I ask you to ascertain jeff skilling' s
Availability for that evening?
Thanks,
Ehud ronn
