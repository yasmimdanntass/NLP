Steve kean and I finally got to discuss this the other day and we decided
That this effort would likely be too time consuming and costly, particularly
For certain key employees, to justify doing it. It obviously is an
Interesting topic but one that would require alot of attention (and possibly
Money) to participate in fully. Thanks for your attention to this.
