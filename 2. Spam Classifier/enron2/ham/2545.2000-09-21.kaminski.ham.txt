Subject: re: enron/stanford program
Nick,
I spoke with paul racicot, head of trading for ebs, north america this
Morning. He said that he is happy to send the $100, 000 for your program
From his budget. I have forwarded to him the draft letter to accompany the
Funds and will try to follow up to make sure that the money is sent promptly.
