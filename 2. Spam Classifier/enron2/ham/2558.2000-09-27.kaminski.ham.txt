Subject: re: re: software license
Ms. Geman,
I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an escrow agreement for
Placing the software in escrow with your attorneys. Please review and have
Your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.
I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a
Different enron subsidiary on october 13. If at all possible, could we try
To get the software license agreement and the escrow agreement wrapped up
Before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where i
Left off?
I think we are just about in agreement on the software license portion.
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern
Regarding providing a response time of 2 business days. I do not have any
Answers regarding that - maybe vince kaminskI or stinson gibner can respond
On this issue.
I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within
The next 2 weeks if possible.
Thank you,
Karla feldman
Enron corp.
