Subject: mission impossible - hr associate groups recommendation and next
Steps
Rhonna,
Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this
Message (vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will
Need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).
The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps
Required to implement the hr associate groups recommendations for the
Development of an hr" value index" at enron.
I would anticipate we will need approx 45 minutes.
David
