John,
I shall be in paris and london next week. We can schedule a call sometimes
Next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call
(paris time)
Would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call
Sometimes around 3 - 4 p. M. Our time.
Please, indicate which day works best for you.
Vince

Vince,
Good morning. Unfortunately i' ll be in milwaukee visiting harley - davidson
About a book revision project both thursday and friday. How about early
Next week. I appreciate your patience with me. When you suggested a time
Last week I was" unprepared" and embarassed to call and expose my
Ignorance. Since then I have re - read the enron gas services case and have
A pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
Sides of the business. The other theme that I have heard many enron
Speakers use is the" de - regulation" of markets. This certainly played a
Factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.
If you' ll let me know when it' s convenient to call next week i' ll have some
Notes put together. I' m teaching a class for a colleague on monday so
Anytime after that is great.
Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip.
John
P. S. I saw that the univ of new orleans has an energy finance endowed
Chair for a financial economist open. If you ever decide to move back to
The life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a
Post.
