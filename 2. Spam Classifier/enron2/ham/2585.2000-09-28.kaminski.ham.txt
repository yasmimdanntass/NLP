Subject: stinson gibner & hector campos
Ken lay gave a high profile presentation on the current natural gas supply
And price situation at a recent conference held by the interstate oil and gas
Compact commission, and some of the best graphs came from work that stinson
And hector did (see the attached, slides #11, #12, #14, & #15).
I really appreciate their research and hope to be able to use their talents
Again for presentations for the office of the chairman..
