Subject: indication dates for sharad' s visit
HI vince,
Having discussed with sharad, we think it would make sense for sharad to go
To houston for a few weeks starting at the end of october. This would
Overlap with ben' s visit in november and so some alternative arrangement
Would have to be made for accommodation. If he goes after ben then there
Will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until
Early next year. Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so
Then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.
Out: sat 21 st october
Return: saturday 16 th december
Regards,
Anjam
