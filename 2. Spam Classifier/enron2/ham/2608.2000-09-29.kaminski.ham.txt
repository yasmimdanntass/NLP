HI vince:
This zeigham khokher at the university of texas at austin, finance
Department.
?
I need some publicly available data that unfortunately is not available
Here.? It is basically the historical prices for price of oil, gas and gold
Futures contracts and options.
?
Again the data is strictly public info and not proprietary at all.? Let me
Know if there is a central data person at enron who would be able to help.?
All help will be of course gratefully acknowledged.
?
Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk at ut this fall? And look
Forward to seeing you then.
?
Regards
Zeigham
