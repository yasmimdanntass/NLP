Vince,
I have received the full - time offer package from associate & analyst program
Last week. Apparently they have pretty tight deadlines. Because of a certain
Clause in the contract, I may have to give them an answer by october 16 th.
Since we discussed this before I left enron, I felt it would be a good idea
To inform you of the recent developments.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding both part - time and
Full - time employment opportunities with the research group.
Best,
