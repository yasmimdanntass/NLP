Title: current challenges in modeling power price volatility
Author: dr. Vince kaminski, head of quantitative research, enron capital &
Trade resources
Abstract:
The power market developments in the us have created several unique
Challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors
Underlying
The exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
Them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
Expanded customer choice.
