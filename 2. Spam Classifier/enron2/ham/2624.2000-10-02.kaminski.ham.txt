Subject: re: joint probabilities
Bob -
I' ve edited our numbers a bit on the azurix analysis and would like you to
Re - run the joint probabilities tables.
Please note that i' ve got 2 cases in the model now - an optimistic case and a
Pessimistic case. I hope you can run both cases. (you will need to toggle
For case 1 or 2 - real complicated stuff!!)
Please keep everything else the same (ie, the currency probabilities, rab
Probabilities, etc.)
Thanks for your help.
