Subject: 2001 budget
I need your help... I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget
And I am showing a significant increase from last year. Did we have an
Increase in headcount? I do not know your actual budget for 2000. I used
The information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year
(see 2000 budget tab in the attached file). The attached file contains the
Following tabs:
Budget vs budget comparison of 2000 vs 2001
Allocation allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21. 7% to ena
2000 budget estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
Research 2001 budget
The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in
Your template (corp). Plus, I have to add a & a overhead cost that corp will
Bill us for a & a program (line 78). Can we meet to discuss the allocation to
Ena and the increase in plan? I am open all week except for wednesday
Between 10 and 11. Thank you.
