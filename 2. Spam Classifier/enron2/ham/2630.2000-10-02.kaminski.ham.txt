Wendy:
I am so sorry for the late notice, but vince will be in london for 1 day
Only,
Monday, october 2 nd. He has had some time freed up and if paul and
Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the grosvenor house,
870 - 400 - 8500. His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
Would work.
Regards,
Shirley
