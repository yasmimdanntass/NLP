Subject: reporting lines
Vince
I' ve just had a chat with richard, who feels strongly that the natural
Synergies between, and independence of, research and structuring will be best
Served if I report to tani.
I expressed my concerns that I want to keep a strong link with:
1. Accountability to the trader sense of urgency, and
2. Traders' willingness to spend money where necessary.
Richard suggested that we have a strong" dotted line" of reporting in to him,
And that he will be available to support these areas. We' ll meet regularly
To keep richard in the loop.
I filled richard in on the fact that I wish to change the nature, not just
The size, of the research group, which will involve significant changes in
Headcount and investment in hardware/software.
I' ve no doubt that my main concerns of accountability and budget support will
Be met whether I report to richard formally or informally.
TanI has indicated that she' d be prepared to have research report to her if
Required.
All the best,
Steve
