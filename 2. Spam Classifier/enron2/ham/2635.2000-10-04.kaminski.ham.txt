Subject: hello from charles shen at williams co.
Dear vince:
How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
Me, we met in a conference last year in houston. After
Having been working for williams for about two years,
Now I am ready to make a move. I have heard enron is a
Great company, I am wondering whether there is any
Opportunity for me, either in research group or in
Structure group
Here is brief description about myself: right after i
Got my ph. D. On finance and econometrics from duke
University in 1998, I joined williams energy trading
Company as a quantitative analyst. Now I am lead quant
And in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
Research and modeling about electricity,
Load - following deal and tolling deals.
If you need any additional information, please feel
Free to call me at 918 - 409 - 4308. I look forward to
Hearing from you soon, thank you.
Sincerely,
Charles
