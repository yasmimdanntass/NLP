Dear celeste and kristin:
I am re - sending information regarding the wharton entrepreneurship
Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
Participate in the expo. We are expecting the conference to double in
Size with more than 1000 attendees. In addition, we would like to
Emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
Of the" dot. Com" world including in large, innovative companies such as
Enron. We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
Christy jones of trilogy and pcorder as well as anita roddick of the
Body shop. We would be very interested to have the participation of
Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a
Participant in our career expo.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Cassandra santos
