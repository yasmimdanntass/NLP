Subject: briefing robert johnston on metals
Vince,
Sorry, I was not able to take your call this morning, to avoid distractions i
Was editing a technical coner article on ppp out of my office. Last friday,
I called robert johnston immediately after you told me to contact him to
Brief him on nonferrous metals. I let him know that I was scheduled to speak
About metals in our research meeting on october 12 th. I also talked with him
A few weeks ago that I would like to meet with him and scott tholan to brief
Them on metals. Robert did not arrange the meeting. I arranged a meeting
For 10: 30 tomorrow to take them both through the metals fundametals speech.
The london metals confererence sounds great, since I have five years
Experience in metals fundamental analysis and pricing, I would also like to
Attend. Many of my new research group customers are asking for my expertise
In this new business for enron. I could certainly help our customers better
By getting the latest information on metals. Please let me know if this is
Ok with you.
Regards,
Maureen
