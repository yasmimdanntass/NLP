Subject: london research intranet
Felipe
Following our discussion please close down all intranet access to the london
Research group site. Inaccuracies have been found in the content which may
Have implications for our trading operations. Closing the site will force
Traders to contact our group direct, ensuring only correct information is
Passed.
The site will be completely overhauled over the coming months, so I see
Little benefit in reinstating access to the site in the near future.
Many thanks,
Steve
