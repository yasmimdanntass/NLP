Agenda
Winners and losers in the e - commerce shakeout
Thursday, october 19, 2000 (dinner)
Friday, october 20 (conference)

Jointly sponsored by the
William and phyllis mack center on managing technological innovation,

Conference themes & objectives
E - commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
Shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
Industry. This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
Industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
E - commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a" winner" when the shakeout
Hits, full - force.
Shakeouts are spawned in the boom - and - bust environment of hot emerging
Markets. An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
Contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology. As competition
Intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
Ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.
Few ecommerce markets - - whether e - tailing online exchanges or others - - - will
Be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts. This conference will
Combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with the
Latest thinking about the unique features of e - commerce, to identify
Successful strategies for surviving a shakeout.
Questions to be addressed include:
- are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
Applicable to ecommerce? What are the early warning signs of an impending
Shakeout?
- which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout? Will there
Be single or multiple winners?
- which companies are likely to survive? What strategies will the winners
Use?
There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
Contribute to prospects for survival. How important are first mover
Advantages and building brand equity? What do incumbents have to do to
Prevail? Which business models are most robust? How important is the
Ability to manage strategic partnerships?
These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
Dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia and
Wall street.
