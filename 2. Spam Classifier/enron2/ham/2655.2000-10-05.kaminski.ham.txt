Subject: re: implementing term - structure of correlations for power
Tanya,
While there is seasonal correlations in power, especially for np - 15
And sp - 15 (same region), the term structure of correlations can be input.
However, the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold
Between np - 15 and, say, rlb (neepool), though one would imagine that
Relationship would still be seasonal (summer/winter), with greater noise.
Even if the correlational term structure is to be done for power, different
Rules would have to be inputted for different regions.

Vlady
2) correlations are periodic with a period of 1 year (this means we can use
12 correlation matrices calculated from
First 12 forward contracts and apply these matrices to other forward months);
3) using decay factor makes the curves a little smoother.
Implementation of multiple correlation matrices will not affect the speed of
Calculations in var model significantly.
Please, give me your response,
Thanks,
Tanya.
