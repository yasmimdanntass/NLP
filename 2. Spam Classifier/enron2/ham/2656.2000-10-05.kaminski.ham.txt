Subject: re: factor loadings for primary curves
Tanya,
I went through the comparisons for the liquids curves and the
Appearance of clear parallel shifts, etc, do begin to emerge when fewer
Forward prices are used. It looks sensible. I have passed the graphs over
To the liquids people, and I have asked them to identify rough term structure
Months when illiquidity begins for these curves. It might coincide with your
Assumptions. I am surprised by brent and dubai, which should be wtI - clones.

Subject: re: factor loadings for primary curves
Naveen & vlady,
Jin yu finished debugging the vatrfacs code and now it calculates factor
Loadings for every" primary" curve (except power curves).
I am sending you the calculated factors:
Most of them don' t look good. 60 forward prices were used in calculations for
Each commodity.
I reran the code using fewer forward prices depending on the commodity
(12 prices for c 3 gc, mtbe, nc 4, so 2,
17 prices for nxho, 18 - for sa,
24 for c 2 gc, lax _ jfk,,
30 - for condensate, dubaicrude, brent,,
48 for nsw, semichem - risi)
These results are in
Most of them look much better.
Please, review.
We will have to add a column in rms _ main _ curve _ list to specify how many
Forward prices we want to use for each commodity,
And then use the new factors in the var model.
Tanya.
