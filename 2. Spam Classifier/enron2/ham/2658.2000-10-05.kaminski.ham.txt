Subject: re: current var issues
Here are the current issues related to var and credit models:
1. Factor loadings (fl) for all" primary" commodities:
- the code is tested;
- factors loadings have been calculated for every primary curve and examined
Closely by research;
- using different number of maturities for fl calculations (it);
- selecting" good" curves, setting mappings for the others (rac);
2. Reviewing power var model:
- implementing term structure of correlations (preliminary research is in
Progress by research, to be implemented by it);
- implementing caps in var model (it);
- jumps for intramonth prices (re - examine prices behavior, research);
3. Historical ff vols (research, rac);
4. Interest rate and fx:
- preliminary research is completed (research);
- implementation in risktrack (it);
5. Credit model:
- resolving the problem of identical runs giving different results (it with
Research' s help);
6. Mg metals var model:
- merging with risktrack (rac, it, research);
- refining the model (research);
7. Var calculations for uk curves:
- merging with risktrack, elimination spreadsheets (rac, it, research);
- looking closely at var calculations for each commodity;
8. Merchant portfolio var:
- unification with equity var model;
9. Fat tails modeling (research);
Let me know what I missed.
Thank you,
Tanya.
