Subject: re: mission impossible - hr associate groups recommendation and next
Steps
I notice my calender doesn' t yet seem to have this meeting scheduled. I will
Ask kay chapman (since rhonna has now deserted me!) to help put a time
Together. Drew/mary, fyI sorry I didn' t get a chance to send you this before.
Let me know if you want to attend, happy to have you there.
Gerry, can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we
Are looking to achieve here. In broad terms I am looking to do the following:
Update all on project we set hr associate group and their recommendations
Discuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think
We should also incorporate (see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by
Associate group below).
Reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree:
Team for doing so
Resources and timimg
Methodology for agreeing final version.
My ambition is that we (but in particular andrea, bob, gerry, tim, tana, dan,
Neil, myself and possibly suzanne if she can given the work she had already
Done in this area) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without
The need for a formation of a new team or group. Obviously everyone welcome
To participate.
Tana/dan,
Can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they
Can review before meeting. Could you also agree within your team who you
Would like to attend this meeting (I would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend
Rather than all).
Thanks
David

Subject: mission impossible - hr associate groups recommendation and next
Steps
Rhonna,
Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this
Message (vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will
Need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).
The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps
Required to implement the hr associate groups recommendations for the
Development of an hr" value index" at enron.
I would anticipate we will need approx 45 minutes.
David
