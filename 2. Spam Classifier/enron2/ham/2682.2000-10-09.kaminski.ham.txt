Subject: thanks
Maureen - thanks for your outstanding presentation on friday. Sorry again for
The difficulties in scheduling.
I can see some excellent collection opportunities for our group as a result
Of your presentation and look forward to discussing them with you on my
Return. We think we can get excellent info on production & exports in
Russia, as well as good insight into antI - dumping out of dc and the wto.
Labor unrest, environmental problems, civil unrest are other possibilities.
Fyi, the speeches from today' s lme seminar will be posted on the lme website
Tomorrow. You may be particularly interested in the outlooks for aluminum,
Nickel, and copper.
