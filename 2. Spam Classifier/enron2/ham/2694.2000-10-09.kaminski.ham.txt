Subject: enron in india
Mark,
Two points.
1. You probably know about it already. Abhay mehta, the author of" power
Play", is on a
Tour of the united states. Please, take a look at the information about a
Meeting last sunday
At stanford university. The web site address is given below. My wife went to
The presentation and told me it was quite critical about enron. About 40
People attended.
2. I was approached by john martin, a professor of finance at baylor, to
Write jointly an
Academic paper on enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an
Article on ebs.
I have suggested a different topic: enron - case study of a company
Reinventing itself.
I made a few points to john:
A. Enron' s evolution did not just happen by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far - reaching
Strategy developed by the management.
B. In the process of its evolution enron changed its environment. I came up
With a term
" proactive evolution", as opposed to" reactive evolution."
C. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality
Of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
Empowerment.
D. There are very few companies that match enron' s experience and
Accomplishemnts.
The paper could become a standard reading at the mba courses on corporate
Strategy
And would help greatly our recruiting efforts.
Writing the paper would require interviews with ken, jeff and a few other key
Players.
Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.
Vince
