Martin,
It' s ok for walter to use remaining hours. No real cost to enron,
Just the benefits.

Subject: power flow software question
Walter coffer contacted me regarding whether we still have power flow
Software available. We do have almost all of a 200 execution - hour license
For pss/e, which was purchased for the transmission congestion project last
Summer. This was purchased by east power trading. Should walter want to use
The remaining hours, who has authority to grant this?
Thanks,
Martin
