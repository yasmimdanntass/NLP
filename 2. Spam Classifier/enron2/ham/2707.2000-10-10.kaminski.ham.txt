Subject: exploration data as the root of the energy (oil) supply chain and
Consulting
Good morning vince:
1) we met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last
Week. I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of
The (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data
Driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of
Broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.
I asked adler or reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.
Have they contacted you yet?
2) i' m converting to consultant - i' ve had a great year here but need to get
Back north more often (family). I will be converting to consultant status
Starting next week. Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do
For you or your team to help out.
