Subject: seismic data on oil & gas field development via satellite
Mike,
Using nasa satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a houston
Data center to consolidate and centrally process 3 d seismic data surveys for
Oil and gas extraction, exploration and development could save the petroleum
Industry more than $300 million dollars annually through reduced operational
Expenses. Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the
Finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon
$15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner) in
Revenue. By re - selling this data to market analysts or by internally using
This data for forecasting future oil/gas production enron could increase the
Accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally. By
Holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), enron would have a
Significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas. (vince' s team
Is quantifying the valuation of this information)
Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data
Transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at spacedata - william k. Aylor,
Calculated using $22/barrel oil.
Based upon your availability, jon adler and I would like to make a
Presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the enron
Potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17 - 20 october).
