Ehud,
I am flying back in the evening and dinner would be difficult.
I shall be glad to join you for lunch,
Shirley, as I understand gave you my requirements for the av.
My flight arrives at 8: 30 a. M. I can meet you at your office in the morning
And
We can talk about the conference and other issues.
