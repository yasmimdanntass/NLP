The energy symposium is one of the largest energy conferences in the world and
We are successful in attracting senior energy executives as speakers to this
2 - day event. This year' s event will be november 28 & 29.
The energy symposium is much more that just an" accounting conference."
Industry leaders discuss a range of topics and share their perspectives on
Strategic, economic, political, financial and operating issues.
Participants find the networking aspect of the symposium to be especially
Valuable. There is ample time during the event for them to meet and talk with
Their counterparts and colleagues in the industry. And it is a premier
Marketing opportunity for arthur andersen, where more than 300 partners and
Managers get to spend two days with 700 executives from the energy and
Utilities
Industry in a forum.
The symposium check - in begins monday, november 27 at 6 p. M., with a cocktail
Reception in the galleria ballroom foyer. Arthur andersen personnel are
Encouraged to attend for an opportunity to network with colleagues, clients
And
Prospective clients in an informal setting.
Thank you in advance and I look forward to seeing you and your clients in
Houston.
