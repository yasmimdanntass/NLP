Dear vince,
How are you? Well I hope.
I hope you don , t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months ago
I left risk publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only a
Few months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of a
Corporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector.
Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am
Very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it
Would be great to work for enron because it is such a dynamic company and i
Am planning to approach the london office to discuss any opportunities,
Which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing
And research, although I am very open - minded at the moment. I wondered
Whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in london.
I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be
Fantastic vince.
Thanks and best regards,
Vicky windsor
