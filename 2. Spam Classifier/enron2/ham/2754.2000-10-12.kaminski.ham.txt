Subject: re: options model
Jeff,
I got 20 cents for the swith option per dth. My assumptions are as follows:
Price curve assumption:
Waha - - - if - waha
La plata pool and tw (ignacio) - - if - epso/sj
California border - - ngI - socal
Correlation assumption:
Waha - sj 95%
Socal - sj 90%
See the attached spreadsheet for more info. Call me for questions.

Subject: options model
Zimin,
We' re trying to price out a" live" options deal. Here are the parameters:
Volume: 32, 000 dth/d
Term: jan. 1, 2002 through oct. 31, 2006 (58 mos.)
Price: one part rate, $0. 2175/dth, plus applicable fuel
Primary receipt/delivery points: (east - to - east transport)
Receipt: la plata pool (use san juan, blanco price equivalent)
Delivery: waha area
Option:
Alternate delivery pnt.: california border (east - to - west transport)
Price:
Floor - $0. 2175/dth, plus 4. 75% pipeline fuel, plus 50% of the difference
Between the california border index
Price and the san juan basin index price. Specifically, we' ll use:
(socalgas large pkgs. Minus tw (ignacio, pts. South))
An important things to consider:
This option is only for alternate firm deliveries. Alternate firm is really
Just a glorified version of interruptible.
Can you run the option model and tell me what is the dollar value of this
Rather" unpure" option?
I appreciate it. Give me a call at 3 - 1521 if you have any questions. Also,
Can you get us an answer by friday, 10/13/00? We' re looking to get the
Proposal out to the customer by the end of the week if possible. Thanks.
