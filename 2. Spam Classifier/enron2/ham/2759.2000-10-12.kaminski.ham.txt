Subject: mec advisory board meeting
We are still in discussions with mec about a transaction, but it seems to be
Moving in the right direction. They have asked to set up an advisory meeting
In december to meet the senior team members. Mr. Plotnick indicated that he
Expects to have his cto in place by then. I am trying to arrange our first
Meeting the week of december 5 or december 12. Please send me a short list
Of times you have available for a two hour meeting.
Once again, I would like to thank each of you for your help with this
Project.
Regards,
Mark
