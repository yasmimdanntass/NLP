What a kind and thoughtful man you always are, vince.... I have always
Appreciated
That in you! I just moved to another position this week - with sheila
Knudsen in ena
Compensation, but I will always remember how wonderful you are with the
Associates
And analysts in the program, and will miss having the opportunity to touch
Base with
You occasionally. Thank you for being the special man you are!
Carol
P. S. I doubt that you know who I am, but I had worked with the program for
Two years,
Having been hired by mike smalling in october 1998. When I first moved to
Houston
(from ohio) and enron, I rode the #35 bus for a short while. You helped me
Find enron the first
Day I rode it, but I didn' t know who you were until I saw you at our super
Saturday
Activities. You will never know how much that assistance meant to me - a
Shy,
Street - dumb girl from toledo, ohio, in a city like houston, who didn' t know
How to
Ride a bus! All of enron loves you, and I know why!

You are right, vince.... Celeste and I did discuss it, and she approved his
Feb. Start date.
Datren does know about that, so it sounds like it is cleared up.
Thanks so much, and we are sorry for the confusion!

" my graduation date (ph. D. Candidate from lsu) is dec. 2000. Celeste roberts
Has informed me that I would have the option of starting work feb. 2001. I am
Under the impression that I will start in feb. 2001. My offer letter has a
Start date
Of aug. 2001. If this is a problem, please give me a call.
Looking forward to working at enron.
Thanks a million,
Datren w."
Please let me know if he may in fact start in feb. 2001, and if so, do you
Have
A specific date for him, or may he choose?
Thanks, celeste,
