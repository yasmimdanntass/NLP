You are right, vince.... Celeste and I did discuss it, and she approved his
Feb. Start date.
Datren does know about that, so it sounds like it is cleared up.
Thanks so much, and we are sorry for the confusion!

Celeste,
I just received datren williams' acceptance with the following note attached:
" my graduation date (ph. D. Candidate from lsu) is dec. 2000. Celeste roberts
Has informed me that I would have the option of starting work feb. 2001. I am
Under the impression that I will start in feb. 2001. My offer letter has a
Start date
Of aug. 2001. If this is a problem, please give me a call.
Looking forward to working at enron.
Thanks a million,
Datren w."
Please let me know if he may in fact start in feb. 2001, and if so, do you
Have
A specific date for him, or may he choose?
Thanks, celeste,
Carol
