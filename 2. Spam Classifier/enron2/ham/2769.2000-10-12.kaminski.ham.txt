All
Following discussions between matt, vince kaminski, and me, matt has decided
He' d like to make a longer - term commitment to research. With this in mind
We' d like to request that matt is switched from a & a to the specialist track.
Vince and I feel this is clearly in the best interests of enron given matt' s
Proven strengths in quant analysis.
How do we proceed?
All the best,
Steve
