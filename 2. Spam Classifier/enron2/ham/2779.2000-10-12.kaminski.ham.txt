Subject: presentation for cal berkeley
Hello vince and john,
I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus. We can
Tweak these however we feel appropriate to match cal berkeley on monday. I
Believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest
Shown at the career fair). These tend to be fairly informal. I was thinking
That we could present in this order:
Vince gives the enron overview presentation (30 minutes)
John gives the global technology specific presentation (20 minutes)
Ashley goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)
Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you
Feel comfortable with the layout and content. I am meeting with john today
At 1: 30 - vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that
Would be great.
If you have any questions, please don' t hesitate to contact me. 3 - 3589
Thanks,
Ashley

Mellon. The only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end. There
Are also speaker notes that go into greater detail. - - - >
