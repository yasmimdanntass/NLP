I think he can do it, vince, but ut has asked him to speak at a leadership
Conference also on 2/16, which rick causey is encouraging him to do. He has
All the information (I just sent it home in his mail as he returned this
Afternoon from a week of travel), so will press him to make a decision
Tomorrow. He may decide to do both or one or the other... I' ll let you know
As soon as I do. Srs

Rick/vince:
Good morning.
Further to my discussions with vince during his visit to the energy finance
Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether mr. Skilling' s
Assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
