Rick/vince:
Good morning.
Further to my discussions with vince during his visit to the energy finance
Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether mr. Skilling' s
Assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote
Speaker at our conference.
With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud ronn
