Subject: re: template for a proposal
Mark & todd
Vince and I have been working along those lines and have narrowed the search
To (1) scripps institution of oceanography, (2) lamont - daugherty earth
Observatory, and (3) cola - center for ocean, land and atmosphere. We have
Contacted the principles at each of these institutions, made on - site visits
To the facilities, and verbaly explored preliminary research program
Proposals.
Perhaps we could meet next week to coordinate this effort.
