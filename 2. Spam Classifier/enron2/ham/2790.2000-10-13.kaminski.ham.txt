Subject: seismic data via satellite
I am preparing a summary or our thursday discussions to be used as a
Background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders. I will
Circulate this for review/correction later today, or, at the latest, monday.
Greg, you mentioned that enron had participated in a speculative survey in
The gulf of mexico that was successful. It might be useful to get more info
On this. Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not
Continued to do this, etc.
Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3 - d surveys are in deep
Water. I read recently that shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea
Drilling/extraction project in the gulf. What oil price is required to make
These kinds of projects viable financially?
