Subject: re: option p & l
Brad,
I was extreamly busy yesterday. Sorry for answing your question till now.
Although I am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma, this is what i
Think the system is doing:
Curve shift = today' s price - yesterady' s price
P/l due to curve shift = today' s market value using today' s price curve (with
Everything esle the same as yesterday' s) - yesterday' s market value using
Yesterday' s price curve.
So p/l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order
Terms.
We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0. 5 * gamma * (price
Change) 2) for gamma contribution and? Define delta = curve shift - theoretical gamma.?? Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the delta change,? Especially when you have big price change due to higher order contribution.?? Let me know your thoughts on this.??? Best wishes,?? Zimin????????? Brad horn 10/12/2000 07: 11 am??
