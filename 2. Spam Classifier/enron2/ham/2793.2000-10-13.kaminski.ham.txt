Vince,
I' m really feeling like a blind mouse about this because I haven' t (nor has
Christie, mike and mark) read mr. Mehta' s comments. I believe that we would
Be better equipped to discuss the course of action that should be taken, if
Any, after we are well versed with mr. Mehta and his perspectives.
Although, I do suggest that if we do decide to proceed, we should approach it
By addressing the issues mr. Mehta discussed under a different premise, i. E.
Sponsor a speaking engagement where one of the speakers' topics would be
Related to mr. Mehta' s topic - allowing us to strategically tell our side of
The story without it appearing that this is a planned rebuttal. We should
Specifically invite those who attended mr. Mehta' s engagement, but not limit
It to this group.
Let' s all discuss this once our group has read mr. Mehta' comments.
Regard,
Cindy

Cindy,
I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which mr. Mehta spoke,
Not a general press release. I agree that a general message to the world
Would
Attract attention.

Vince,
You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book. I agree with you that we
Don' t want increase there revenues even by a $1. 00, although my
Recommendation (and mark palmer' s as well) is that we should pursue a
Rebuttal for the following reasons:
As I mentioned I scoured the internet (britannica. Com, amazon. Com, yahoo. Com
And dow jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore mr.
Mehta' s distribution must not be wide at all. Consequently, his comments may
Not have reached a large audience. Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw
More attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with
Counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us. So far, we have
Not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to mr. Mehta' s
Enron bashing. May be we should' leave the stones unturned'.
Let me know what you think. Also, please contact me when it is convenient
For me to borrow the book from you.
Regards,
Cindy

Cindy,
I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important
Chapters.
I don' t think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of
The book.
In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by mr.
Mehta. The person in charge of
Our dhabol operation is a stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an
Invitation
To speak at the same forum and present the facts as they are. He should be
Here for the management
Conference.

Good afternoon vince,
Christie patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently
Attended at stanford. At this coference abahy mehta discussed his/her
Recently published book' power play' - that certainly does not flatter
Enron. I have conducted a search on amazon. Com, britannica. Com and dow jones
And I am coming up empty handed. Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble
Your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow
My search.
I greatly appreciate it.
Regards,
Cindy
