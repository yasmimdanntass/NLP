Steve,
Elena chilkina can give you historical data.
Historical fwd curves can be obtained from paulo
Or alex, among others. Of course, our internal forward curves
Represent a very sensitive information.

Subject: power question
HI vince
Who should I contact for power queries now grant has gone? A colleague here
In london (didier magne) is giving a talk on power/gas arbitrage, and the
Consequent convergence of these markets.
Do you have any presentations on this area, or illustrative figures on the
Increase in power/gas correlation?
Many thanks,
Steve
