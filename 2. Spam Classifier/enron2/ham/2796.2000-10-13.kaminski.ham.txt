Steve,
I am calling anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to houston.
If he decides to stay in houston, you should meet with him to convey
The concerns regarding his performance.

Subject: support for exotica
All
Sharad' s investigations of exotica' s status in london have turned up a very
Confused state of affairs. This isn' t being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can' t be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn' t willing or able to provide all the information
Sharad might need to support exotica.
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of
Exotica' s valuations.
Sharad will now request information from anjam via email to leave a trail,
And I want to alert you to the fact that sharad will be cc' ing you in on
These emails.
If things don' t improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in
Extracting this information from anjam.
Many thanks,
Steve
