Subject: nelson nele interview
Vice:
I interviewed nelson last week. Here is my feedback:
1) very communicative
2) good professional experience - works as a consultant
3) good quantitative background
He lacks a background in finance, which may be a minus for a position in the
Group. I beleive he may be valuable for other areas that deal with emissions
And pollutants.
