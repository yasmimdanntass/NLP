Subject: charles chen interview
Vince/tanya:
I interviewed charles today 10: 30 am. Here are my impressions:
1) excellent professional and managerial experience.
2) very good technical background.
Deal valuation and
Model implementation
3) promisses to fit very well into the group' s culture.
The only issues I see is that he would have to leave a high level position at
His current employee.
