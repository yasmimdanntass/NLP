HI jeff!
I know you received the information below. Additionally, I have 2 people
From broadband services meeting us there friday (one is tracI warner who set
Up the rice u deal). Further, i' ll be meeting with amy briggs regarding the
Entrepeneurship conference nov 30 th and dec lst. I' ve already spoken with
Her and tom piazze and both independently confirmed as you suspected that we
Committed to sponsor at the $10, 000 level. This entitles us to banners,
Panels, posters, and most importantly, a keynote address. I' ll discuss the
Keynote address with her but would appreciate your thoughts in advance as to
How you' d like to see the keynote speech executed (suggestions for topics,
Proposed speaking candidates, when in the conference you' d like to see
Enron' s speech, etc). I' ll review the trip with you when we return.
Thanks jeff!
