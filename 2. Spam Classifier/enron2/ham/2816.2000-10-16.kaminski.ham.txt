Bob,
Here are a few comments on this note:
1. Deal with seismic company was done by a mark peterson who is still with
Enron. I haven' t caught up with him for details but it had to do with
Underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey. Timing is important.
Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided
That they didn' t need enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no
Sales.
2. 3 - d surveys will happen where there is an abundance of e & p activity or
Be spurred on by successes in a given basin. While activity continues in the
Gulf of mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the
Deep water. Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and
Worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the
Time. I don' t think that deep water sedimentation/depositional systems were
Completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.
Concepts have evolved quite quickly. The point is that many deep water
Accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations. These
Sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies
Were drilling surface structures. The large reserves are needed to pay for
The corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.
I believe that finding and development costs ($/ barrel) are at least two to
Three times shelf f & d costs in the gulf of mexico. This differential is
Probably large with international projects (and that doesn' t take into
Account political risk).
I' ll look forward to more involvement if and when this project/concept goes
Forward. Feel free to forward this to all participants.
Greg

I am preparing a summary or our thursday discussions to be used as a
Background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders. I will
Circulate this for review/correction later today, or, at the latest, monday.
Greg, you mentioned that enron had participated in a speculative survey in
The gulf of mexico that was successful. It might be useful to get more info
On this. Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not
Continued to do this, etc.
Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3 - d surveys are in deep
Water. I read recently that shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea
Drilling/extraction project in the gulf. What oil price is required to make
These kinds of projects viable financially?
