Subject: seismic data via satellite
I have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior
To a possible meeting with them.
Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy 2) completeness and 3) coverage
Of the areas we want to explore.
As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil
Reserves are 1, 000 billion bbls. Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would
Add only 0. 1%. While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not
Looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time
Frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.
