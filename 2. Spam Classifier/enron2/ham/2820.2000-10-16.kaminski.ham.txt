Subject: re: informs national conference at san antonio
Hi,
Details of our session info. At the informs conference can be found at the
Following link. It' ll be in the afternoon of 11/6 (monday).
Since we have 5 speakers, I expect each of us will have no more than 20
Minutes to present. Please keep that in mind and e - mail me if you have
Any questions. Please also inform me if there will be any changes. Look
Forward to seeing you all in san antonio.
Best regards,
