The review of eric groves' lng model spreadsheet has been completed. No
Independent model was available for use in the comparison; however, the model
Appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and
Revenue elements.
If this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning
Ship usage in the future, additional variables may be needed to represent the
Variability of trip times, weather factors, etc. A reference describing
These possible additions was provided.
