Subject: full - time offer terms
Cantekin,
Dolores muzzy forwarded your e - mail. I apologize for not answering sooner
But I have been travelling.
Unfortunately, the terms of the associate program compensation package are
Not negotiable. We have reviewed our terms and believe we are competitive
With our peers. I have spoken with vince kaminskI who will be calling you to
Discuss.
Given that it has taken 6 days to respond to you, if you are still
Considering enron' s offer of employment I will extend your deadline until
October 24 th.
Please call if you have any other questions.
Sincerely,
Charlene jackson
