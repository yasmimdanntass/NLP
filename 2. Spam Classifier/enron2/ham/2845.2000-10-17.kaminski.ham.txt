Subject: newsletter, monday 23 oct.
Vince,
I see that you are flying around a lot this week, but I wanted to let you
Know how it' s going with the newsletter. I' ve scheduled steve bigelow as the
" person of the week." regarding technical corner, I sent you a copy of
Maureen' s article for your review. Bob lee told me he has also sent you
Something. I' d appreciate your guidance on which one to use. I believe
Maureen' s is time - sensitive, so i' d vote for that one if you' ve had a chance
To look it over.
I' m going to be out of town the rest of today and thursday - friday to attend
My uncle' s funeral in illinois. If you fly over illinois, please wave!: -)
Have a safe trip (s),
Sam
