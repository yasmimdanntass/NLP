Gwyn,
I see no reason why we cannot include the article in monday' s issue. Of
Course, vince will need to review it as he does for everyone' s material. I' m
Forwarding a copy to him with this message.
Regarding the software, you can just initiate a security request online and
Order it. We can put issues online the old way until they set you up with
The new stuff. By the way, i' m going to be gone thursday and friday, so when
Your new issue is ready on friday, you should send it to elena. I know she
Will be here at least in the morning.

Might be appropriate for the tech corner. I' ve attached it below. Please
Advise if we can get this into the tech corner for next week.

Gwyn,
I was successful in my efforts to put your new product on the web site! Have
A look! I know elena may want to modify it a bit, but at least it' s up
There. I have a couple of suggestions for your future efforts:
Get adobe acrobat 4. 0, full version (not just the reader) - - - this will allow
You to publish it in final form from your desk.
Do you have access to the y: drive? It' s a drive mapped off of o:\research
And all of the web pages are there. Let me know, and if you don' t, as long
As you have rights to o:\research, I can come down and map if for you.
Then, all you have to do is print the new edition to pdf, then save it to the
Same spot each time, and it' s automatically online.
Sam
