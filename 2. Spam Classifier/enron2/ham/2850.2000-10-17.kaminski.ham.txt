I wanted to update you on my schedule for december as you are working to
Arrange some time for vince and I to visit with the enron leadership group.
We had talked about the first week in december and that is good for me
Through wednesday dec 6 th. I will be at a conference at harvard on the 7 th
And 8 th. However, the next couple of weeks are also possibilities if we
Can squeeze in some time.
Thanks
