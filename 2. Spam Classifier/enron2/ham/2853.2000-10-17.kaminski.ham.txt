Subject: rotational opportunities within your group
Dear vince,
I am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities
Within your group. I have worked in rac and am currently in financial
Trading. I believe the associate/analyst program may forward you my cv, but i
Thought it good to get in touch personally.
Please let me know if there is someone with whom I could speak about the
Group and its needs for associates.
With best regards,
Kate
