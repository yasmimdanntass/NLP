Subject: requests for help
Krishna,
I have received two additional requests for help from ees.
1. Jeremy blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the
Level of
Our support of ees. It probably makes sense to set up a meeting with jeremy
Asap
And discuss specifics (you, me, and it probably makes sense to invite marty
Sunde
As well).
2. George posey called and asked fro help with statistical sampling of dublin
Customers. Please, give him a call to set up a meeting.
I shall call you tomorrow to discuss both requests.
