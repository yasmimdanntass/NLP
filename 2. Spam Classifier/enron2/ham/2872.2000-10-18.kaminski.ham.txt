Subject: ees risk management presentations for october 25.
Please have your presentations to me by 10 am friday, october 20, 2000. It
Takes a couple of days to get the materials back from the copy center. The
Presentations have to be put in new binders this time and it takes most of a
Day to put everything together in the binders. Therefore, I have to have
The materials to the copy center by friday afternoon in order to get them
Back by monday afternoon or tuesday morning. I will need most of tuesday to
Get everything assembled in the binders. Thus the necessity of having your
Completed presentations by friday morning.
Vince: basket options
Binary (digital) options
Krishna: barrier options
Other complex structures
Thanks for your help on this.
Regards,
Anita
