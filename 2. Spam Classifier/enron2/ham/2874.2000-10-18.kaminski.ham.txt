Subject: jaesoo lew
Vince: jaesoo lew has just returned my phone call. He is interested in
Meeting with you and your group, and would like to do so on wednesday,
10/25/2000. He had already made travel arrangements to fly to a conference
In seattle on 10/25, but is willing to come here for the interviews first and
Then travel from houston to seattle for the seminar. He did ask if we would
Be willing to reimburse him for the additional cost of the ticket, and I told
Him I was sure that you would consider it.
Dr. Lew asked that we schedule his flight into houston for some time after
6: 00 pm on tuesday, 10/24/2000. I will work on the travel arrangements
Tomorrow morning, and keep you advised.
Please call me with any questions,
Molly
