Dear dr. Kaminski
My name is jaesoo lew and I am referred by dr. Wayne lee.
Currently i' ve been working at aquila energy in kansas city as an pricing
Analyst since july 2000. Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
Valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
Since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c + +
Programming using excel dll has been developed, too.
I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
Forward to talking about an opportunity at enron.
My home phone number is 913 - 649 - 0578, dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
This week as dr. Lee informed me. If possible, please let me know your
Expected calling day through the mail. I appreciate your consideration.
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Jaesoo lew
