Vince,
Just an update for you and a question. First, I have talked to christie
And corresponded via e - mail. We don' t have dates to talk to lay, skilling
And fastow as yet but christie is working on it. I will prompt her again
Next week.
The second item of business is a question. I want to see if we can move
Our meeting in spring (business education and the new economy workshop)
Back a week to friday february 23 rd. One of the attendees has a conference
He wants to attend on march 2 nd. Let me know asap if the 23 rd works for
You. I have committments from a number of folks for the workshop and i
Think it will be great fun and a wonderful learning experience for us all.
