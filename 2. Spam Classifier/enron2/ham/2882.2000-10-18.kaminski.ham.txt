Vince,
Please check the university of california energy institute web site (
Http:// www. Ucei. Berkeley. Edu/uceI /). You may already be aware of it but if
You are not, there are lots of paper that I am using as a reference and that
You might be interested in reading them. Also, every year they are holding a
One day power conference in uc berkeley. I' d like to attend the one in march
Of 2001. Is that fine?
Sevil,
