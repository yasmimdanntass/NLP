Subject: files in houston
Hi,
I am trying to retrieve some analysis that I did while I was in houston. It
Is very imporatant that I get these files asap as I need to continue the
Correlation analysis for the uk power/gas desk. I have put in a request to
The resolution center in houston to try and get a back up but
Would like to know if anyone has any further suggestions? I was not told that
The files in this folder were periodically deleted.
I think tanya should have a copy of these files but do not know where she is
Likely to store them.
Thanks in advance,
Kirstee
