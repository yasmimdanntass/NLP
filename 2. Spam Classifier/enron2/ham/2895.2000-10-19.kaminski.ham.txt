Subject: power 2000/eprm 2001
As a speaker at eprm' s highly successful power 2000 event in houston, I am
Writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce myself. I
Will be responsible for the production of all north american eprm events
Having moved from our banking conference and training course division in
July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the eprm team, emma wolfin is
Developing our technology events for waters conferences and joel hanley will
Be starting his new role as an eprm journalist from november lst.
Eprm 2001 will be held in houston on the 14 th, 15 th & 16 th of may and I am
Keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend to call
Each power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would like
To provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some
Issues.
What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference
Seminars at eprm 2001?
What research are you or your company involved in that would justify
Inclusion in eprm 2001?
Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the cutting - edge of
Energy risk management?
Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (regulatory bodies,
Academics, practitioners)
Any assistance at this initial stage of research is appreciated. You can
Email me or call on + 44 20 7484 9883. I look forward to working with you on
This event.

Senior conference producer, eprm conferences
