Vince,
?
I have made contact with fiona grant, director public relations and
Communications enron europe limited, and she mentioned that there are some
Changes to your bios, which are located both on the cover and in the
Preliminary section in" about the authors".? We would appreciate it if you
Could help in? Collecting or passing along these edits? Since these? Are? The
Only items delaying the printing of the book.?
Thanks vince.
