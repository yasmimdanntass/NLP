Subject: exotica (yet again)
HI guys
I need some advice.
Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions
Of exotica. At some point we will need to migrate london office over to your
More up - to - date version, and i' m concerned that there may be rac - style
Implications. I' m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal
Regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.
Do we need to get our heads together to" form a view" before we involve rac
Or the business groups?
Anjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using excel 95, and that
Neither he nor zimin knows how to build/compile the xla using later versions
Of excel. Is this true? If so, then we need to migrate to xlls sooner
Rather than later because of the maintenance implications.
