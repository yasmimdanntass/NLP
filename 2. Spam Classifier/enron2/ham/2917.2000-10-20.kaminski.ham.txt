Subject: offer to rakish (sp?)
Vince,
Norma called and said that rakish had requested stock options instead of a
Signing bonus. She suggested giving $30 k worth of options which would vest
Over a 3 year period, and I told her that I am sure this would be fine with
You. It should cost us less than the offered cash bonus of $20 k.
