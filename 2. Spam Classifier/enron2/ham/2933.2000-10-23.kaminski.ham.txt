Subject: info about enron' s bandwidth market
Dear dr. Kaminski,
I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at ieor very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
Resource on enron' s bandwidth market.
I am a ph. D student at ieor. I work with professor
Oren and professor varaiya from eecs department on
The topic of pricing the internet. In particular, I am designing
Pricing mechanism in the framework of the diffserv
Architecture which is the latest proposal made by
Ietf to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
In enron working on the similar topics.
Thank you very much.
