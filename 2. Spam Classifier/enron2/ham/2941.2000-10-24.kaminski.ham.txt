Today, I announce my departure from enron. Enron is a great company and i
Have enjoyed working with our terrific employees over the last eight years.
Together, we have made enron a successful global company.
With enron , s decreased emphasis on international asset development activity,
However, I have decided to pursue opportunities where I can make greater use
Of my skills and experience. I leave enron with wonderful memories of our
Employees and the many successes we have achieved together. You have my best
Wishes for enron , s continued success.
Joe
