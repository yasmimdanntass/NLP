Note from mark frevert
With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created
This e - mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various
Businesses. I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you
Will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your
Group.
To provide content for future e - mails, contact michelle vitrella in our
Public relations group via e - mail or call her at ext. 3 - 9767. Communication
Is one of the core enron values and I believe this is a great way to improve
Communication across our wholesale businesses.
Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes
To complete  & the pulse  8 survey. This annual survey regarding the work
Experience at enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the
Two - way communication process at enron. Please go to the enron intranet and
Type survey. Enron. Com. It only takes a few minutes, it , s confidential and
Your comments will help make enron a better place to work.
