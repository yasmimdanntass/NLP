In addition, I am writing to inquire whether your organisation can establish
A web link to our program through your organisations' web site. Below is the
Information that is of most importance and that I would like included:

Of course, you could highlight your participation at this event, which will
Include a two - day convention with pre and post convention workshops and an
Asset management forum that will include over 80 senior financial and risk
