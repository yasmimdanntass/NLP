Subject: flight
Dear molly,
I asked about change of the departure city. They said I should send my ticket
Back to get a new ticket. Since aquila provides the ticket, it' s hard for me
To change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
Way flight from houston to seattle on the evening of 25 th? I' m sorry for
This.
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Jaesoo lew
