Bjorn, niamh clarke is going to come to houston from mon afternoon to friday
Next week to work on nvar. She developed var models for mitsubishI and has
Lots of experience in this area. Can you please provide her with the best
People we can from research and rac so we can try and get a better
Understanding and more confidence in our model. I' m sure you agree with me
That if my group is going to make any progress we need to get this sorted.
Thanks in advance.

I think we need to sit down and talk about developing reporting that will
Show the risk in the books. At this point and time it can be derived, but
Only if you know what to look for. I would appreciate if you had some time to
Do so.

Looking at these numbers I think the var model must be waaaaaaaaaay over
Calcing something, most likely the spreads. The net and outright product
Position are negligible. Seems it would take one hell of a daily move to
Loose 12. 7 on these positions.
