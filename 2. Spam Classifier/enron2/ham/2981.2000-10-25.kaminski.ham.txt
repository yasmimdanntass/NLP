Nice talking to you this morning! Below is your interview schedule for

If you need any travel arrangements made.
Coming from the northwest part of houston, your best bet would be to
Take I - 45 into town. There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you
Will probably have to take the mckinney exit from I - 45 (you will need to
Stay in the left lane as you approach town. Exit mckinney to smith street,
Take a right on smith street go to andrews street, take a right on andrews
(the enron bldg. Is on the left), pass the enron bldg. Cross" ruthvan" (1 st
Stop sign) and pull into the allen center parking garage (visitors area on
Your right). Come to the security desk on the lst floor of the enron bldg.
And ask for me. They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby
On the 19 th floor.
