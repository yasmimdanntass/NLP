Good morning vince,
Christie has suggested that I be the liaison for john martin and your
Research project' enron - case study of a company reinventing itself'.
In john' s lastest email, he suggested that the first week of december works
With his schedule - up to december 6 th - or the following couple of weeks
After dec. 8 th. Do these dates work for you as well? If so, I will proceed
In booking one hour sessions with the following enron management:
Ken lay
Jeff skilling
Andy fastow
If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and i
Will try to coordinate with john, jeff, ken and andy. Also, I will send an
Introductory email to john.
I' m looking forward to hearing from you,
Cindy derecskey
