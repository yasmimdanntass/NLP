HI michele
I am writing to confirm that enron will be participating in the
Sales/trading
Panel.
I have some great news. We have decided to give enron the sponsorship
Spot for the sales and trading panel.
Key benifits of being a panel sponsor
- a big enron banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
Sponsor of the entire sales/trading panel
- mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- in addition to the panelist spot on the sales/trading panel, enron
Gets to open the panel session with a 15 - 20 min presentation on general
Trends in the sales and trading industry, an excellent opportunity
For a senior person from enron to address the audience.
Also for folks from enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
Blocked at a discount price at the park hyatt.
I will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
Panel and enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks..
Once again, I would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
The finance conference.
Looking forward to it..
Regards
Suresh balasubramanian
