I promise we will do everything we can. Right now kristin' s assistant, alyse
Herasimchuk, has a call the cornell career office to put him on the
Schedule. If that doesn' t work, kristin will ask for the interviewers to
Stay longer to interview him. Will let you know as soon as we do.
Thanks for everything you do for us.

Correction - I was going too fast last night (you said cornell not carneige
Mellon). Cornell interviews are monday, october 30 & tuesday, october 31. We
Are faxing shmuel oren' s resume to kristin and checking to see if there is
Any time on the closed schedule, or if the interviewers will stay longer to
Include him. I will let you know today if we can make it work.
Sorry my first e - mail was incorrect.

The recruiting process.
His son goes to cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a
Super saturday? I really want
To repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in my recruiting
Efforts.
