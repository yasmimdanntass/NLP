Subject: enron case study
Good morning mr. Martin,
I would like to introduce myself. I currently work with christie patrick and
Michael b rosen in the enron university affairs department.
In recent discussions with christie, she has suggested that I liaise with you
And our management in preparation for your and vince kaminski' s case study.
Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few convenient
Times that work with your schedule. I will work with our management and do
My best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews that fit with your
Outline.
Initially, I will schedule interviews with: ken lay - chairman and ceo, jeff
Skilling - president and coo, and andy fastow - cfo. If you feel that you
May need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to work
Something out the same day, so you don' t have to travel back here. I will
Forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once the
Interviews are scheduled. Do you anticipate drafting specific questions? If
So, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.
I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch base
Very soon.
Regards,
Cindy derecskey
