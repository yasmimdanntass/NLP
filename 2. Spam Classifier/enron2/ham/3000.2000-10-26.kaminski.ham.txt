Subject: presentation on metals
HI maureen,
It was good to meet you last week and hear your presentation on the metals -
Full of advice on what to think about and all the various things that affect
The market place. I am only sorry I had to dash off to the airport - good
Job I left when I did though as check - in took ages!
Anyway, please could you send me through a copy of that presentation either
On email or if it is located on the network somewhere then I could access it
Over the intranet? I will be joining the lme conference tomorrow so am
Currently trying to do a bit of reading in preparation.
Thanks very much in advance & look forward to seeing the presentation over
Here in london.
Kind regards
Alison
