Maureen,
I just wanted to thank you for all your time and your great advice and
Support. I enjoyed talking to you and learning from your experience and also
Meeting all these people involved in f/x trading activities.
I just want to ask you if you could send me over the mail the latest forward
Curves so that we use them to update our long - term plan. For the short term i
Will contact pushkar going forward.
Thanks again and I look forward to talk to you again.
Regards,
Pedro fernando
