Subject: research meeting
All
John sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss
The demands being placed on the research group. I will be making a request
For additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most
Appropriate size for the team.
Assistants: can we aim for week commencing 6 th november?
Vince: would you like to teleconference in?
Many thanks
Steve
