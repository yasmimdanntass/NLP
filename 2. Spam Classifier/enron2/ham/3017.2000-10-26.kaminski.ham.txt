Subject: interview
Dear dr. Kaminski
I would like to thank for the interview opportunity at enron. It was very nice
And pleasant to talk with very talented people.
I wish this interview develop to the further stage of the opportunity.
As matter of fact, I have started the current job at kansas city with an
Internship expiring november 3 rd. I got an permanent job offer from them and i
Think I should decide whether to accept the offer or not very soon. But after
I visited enron, I feel that I want to pursue my career development at enron
For many reasons.
So if the decision process is made soon, I will appreciate it greatly. (i
Apologize for the hurry. I already sent a message regarding my situation to
Molly a minute ago.)
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
Jaesoo
