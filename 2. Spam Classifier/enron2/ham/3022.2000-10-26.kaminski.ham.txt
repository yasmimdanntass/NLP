Subject: weather article - photos?
Dear joseph,
Thank you so much for sending me such an interesting article on the internet
And weather derivatives. I really enjoyed reading it!
I just have one final question - do you have a photograph of yourself (or
The other authors) that you could send me? Tif, gif or jpeg files are fine
So long as they are 300 dpi.
Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.
Best regards,
Jane
