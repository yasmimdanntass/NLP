Dear all,
On 25 th october I announced my resignation from enron europe to pursue other
Opportunities. I just wanted to say that the past 3 1/2 years has been a
Very interesting and positive experience for me, having been a key part of
Such a dynamic and fast - moving organisation. Enron is by far the best
Organisation I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have had the
Opportunity to work here and become a shareholder. I have found it a real
Pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as
Exist within enron europe and enron corp in houston & portland and i
Genuinely wish you the best of success going forward. I would also like to
Take this opportunity to thank vince kaminski, john sherriff and richard
Lewis for hiring me in april 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and
Challenging projects to work on.
I have made some excellent friends at enron and hope to keep them - I have a
Base in london and will probably be visiting houston soon, so please feel
Free to stay in touch!
