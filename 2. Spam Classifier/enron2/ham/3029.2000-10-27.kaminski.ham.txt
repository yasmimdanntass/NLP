Subject: copper curve
Following steve' s note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have
A fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there
Is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.
I am not sure what data you have received from enron metals in london, so i
Am asking tim poullain - patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the
Economic justification proposed as soon as possible. Please direct any
Questions to him or to harry tefoglou. I will be in the tokyo office next
Week, but available via e - mail.
Thanks in advance for your assistance,
Tani
