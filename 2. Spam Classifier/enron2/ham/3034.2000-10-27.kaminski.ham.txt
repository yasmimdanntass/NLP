Subject: get together for dinner
HI everyone,
Before grant leaves houston, I wanted to have a small get - together at my
House for dinner. Since everybody is very busy, I want to schedule a date
Well in advance, so I am suggesting saturday, dec 2. This will be dinner
With family. Please let me know if this works for you.
Thanks,
Vasant
