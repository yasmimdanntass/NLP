Good morning mr. Martin,
I would like to introduce myself. I currently work with christie patrick
And michael b rosen in the enron university affairs department.
In recent discussions with christie, she has suggested that I liaise with
You and our management in preparation for your and vince kaminski' s case
Study. Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few
Convenient times that work with your schedule. I will work with our
Management and do my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews
That fit with your outline.
Initially, I will schedule interviews with: ken lay - chairman and ceo,
Jeff skilling - president and coo, and andy fastow - cfo. If you feel that
You may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to
Work something out the same day, so you don' t have to travel back here. I
Will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once
The interviews are scheduled. Do you anticipate drafting specific
Questions? If so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.
I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch
Base very soon.
Regards,
Cindy derecskey
