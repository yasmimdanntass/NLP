Subject: bad supervisor: me!
Norma,
I have attached an updated org chart for my team.
I think the following changes need to be made
1. Paulo issler is reporting to zimin lu
2. Shalesh ganjoo is reporting to me (who does the system show as his
Supervisor, zimin?)
Also, I just found out that chonawee did not get his mid - year review. I
Didn' t realize that samer takritI never gave him a review. I have found all
Of the mid - year feedback for chonawee, but I don' t have an official" form" to
Fill out for him to sign. Can you send one to me, or what should I do?
Thanks,
Stinson

Send an updated organizational chart of your group so that I can verify the
Correct information.

Shalesh,
Sap is showing ms. Norma villarreal as your hr rep. We don' t have the
Authority to change supervisor names.
Please work with your hr rep to correct this information.
