Presumably if the eastern credit reserve issues take lots of his time away
From enroncredit, we could extend his stay for another week? Especially as
It' s unlikely we could get vasant over in the foreseeable future.

Bryan,
Just fyI - amitava will be diverted for an unspecified portion of his stay
Here next week.
The did the initial coding for software/pricing systems used to value the
Eastern deal. There are over - riding concerns there I or steve l. Can fill
You in on if you like. Problem could be monday morning or all week.
We could press for vasant to re - prioritize his time.
Any thoughts? I haven' t checked with ben about impacts yet...
Ben?
Mike
