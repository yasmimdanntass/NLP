Tani,
Please touch base with lloyd fleming as to whom from rac should review the
Methodology. I view that it is the commercial team' s responsibility to post
The curve, operations responsibility to gather objective information on the
Efficacy of the curve on a (minimum) monthly basis and report all highly
Sensitive curves, rac will not approve or disapprove a curve but question
Methodology/motivations and subsequent changes and do so in a senior
Management forum (i. E., we will tell on those who have suspect curves or
Curve movements). Obviously, we are looking for the best estimate of the
Value of those products in those time buckets today, we also favor object,
Consistent application of methodoology intra and inter commodity.

No problem. We shall look at the curve on monday. I have organized a small
Team to examine
The curve from different perspectives.

Subject: copper curve
Following steve' s note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have
A fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there
Is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.
I am not sure what data you have received from enron metals in london, so i
Am asking tim poullain - patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the
Economic justification proposed as soon as possible. Please direct any
Questions to him or to harry tefoglou. I will be in the tokyo office next
Week, but available via e - mail.
Thanks in advance for your assistance,
Tani
