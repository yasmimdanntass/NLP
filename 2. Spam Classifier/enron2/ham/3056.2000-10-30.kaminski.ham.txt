Mr. Kaminski,
?
Nick perry and I were recently discussing the conference in paris, and we
Gathered that you had some interest in exploring possible uses of our new
Weatherdelta tool - kit.? It is the only application that we know of, that
Can? Model temperature, loads, and power prices in several locations
Simultaneously: thus allowing the user to measure the value an risk in a
Variety of financial instruments, physical obligations and assets.? I have
Attached the product overview sheet, and would be happy to discuss its
Capabilities with you at your convenience.??
?
Nick and I send our regards,
?
