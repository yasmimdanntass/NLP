Subject: lunch conversation
Vince,
We wanted to thank you for your time and support today. We have been
Thinking about our conversation and it may be better to wait until december
Before you approached delainey. This time period would give us the
Opportunity to change his impression of our contributions to gas and power.
Please let us know if you would advise differently.
Thank you,
Kristin and john
