Thanks - based on a" speed read" it would appear that srm sits neatly in the
Volumetric part of your framework. Regarding systems I am keen to preserve
The work kevin has already done and I suspect we can eventually use the
Visualization tools in the risktrac front end to display the results should
We require.
To be honest, I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a
Framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the" angry
Lone voice" in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art
Of risk management generally travel in a similar direction!
I shall make sure our efforts remain in congruence.
