Kristin,
I think that we have done enough for this guy. All we can do is to give
Somebody a chance.
The god helps those who help themselves.
Thanks for all your help and your efforts.

Vince,
I left a message with one of yaron' s roommates on thursday afternoon for him
To call asap for an interview on sunday. I guess he took the wrong number
Down but I do not understand this because the roommate read the number back
To me and it was correct. When I did not hear from yaron I called on friday
And left a voice mail with my cell and office numbers. I still did not hear
From him and called again yesterday morning. I finally received a call at 4
Pm yesterday but by that time my team and myself were half way back to
Houston. Sorry it did not work out. I have a call into charlene jackson as
To how she wants me to proceed and I will get back with you.

Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son' s roommates and left a phone
Number (713) 343 - 3214 which he tried several times and got busy signals.
Today she called just before you called me and left her cellphone number but
He was in classes all morning and got the message in the afternoon. I really
Appreciate your going out of your? Way to help. Perhaps there will be another
Opportunity.?
Shmuel?
