Subject: re: interview with the enron research group
Dear shirley,
Thank you so much for your email. After carefully considering my career
Goals, I feel the associate program with a rotation in the enron
Research group is a better fit. I am really interested in enron and i
Would try to contact your colleagues in the associate program about this
Issue before I schedule an interview with the enron research group. I
Truly apologize for the inconvenience caused and I want to thank you
Again for your kind assistance.
Regards,
Kin tso
