Vince,

Oh.? I sent an invoice to habiba for aus 5 k a while back, and she informed
Me that she passed it along to the people who are handling the agreement now
(I take that as fiona grant in london?).? I will then send out another
Invoice of aus 5 k in the next week or so for the remaining balance.? Should
I have sent the invoice to you?
?
Thanks,
Julie

Julie,
A clarification. We had an agreement with chris and les to contribute? Aus
10, 000
As a part of the cost.

Vince,
Thank you for your email.
We will send you a copy of the book as soon as it is available, which we
Are now estimating to be around 21 november (no need to send us a cheque;
You deserve it).
Just let us know if we should use a different address than your office? In
Houston.
Thanks again for all of your help.
Julie
