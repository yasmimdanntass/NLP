Molly,
We would like to go ahead with an offer to kenneth. After talking to him
Again, I think he will accept.
We would like to offer him the equivalent package to an incoming associate,
Which I understand would be $76 k base and a signing bonus of $20 k.
He position would be a specialist or senior specialist (whichever fits the
Salary) reporting to me.
Thanks for your help,
Stinson
