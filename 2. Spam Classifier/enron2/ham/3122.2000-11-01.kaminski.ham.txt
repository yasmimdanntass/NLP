Dear tanya,
Thank you very much for the offer.
Basically, I can start at anytime if the condition is acceptable.
Currently i' m in the middle of a decision that I can extend my internship or
Accept a job offer at here. But I think that decision should be done soon
Since my original internship expires this week. So the exact time to start
Work at enron depends on how quickly I can get your official offer including
Employment condition.
I hope this will help to your question. If you have any question on me, please
Feel free to contact me.
Again, I appreciate your decision.
Sincerely,
Jaesoo lew
