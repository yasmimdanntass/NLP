Becky,
I gave the%% for egm to shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you
Already.
I assume egm includes f/x - i/r (gary hickerson), weather, insurance (jere
Overdyke),
Oil trading and coal.
For calme I don' t have any info. Let' s split the cost evenly.

Shirley,
Grm is now with egm group. Egm wants to verify that the 17. 5% we are going
To allocate to grm is for the insurance, jere overdyke group. Egm seems to
Think that their weather, mark tawney group, is receiving support from
Research. Also, can we break out the support for calme? Calme is going to
Split into 3 bus and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for research
Supports. If you have any questions, call me. Thanx.
