Subject: change of role
Just a quick note to say that I have now left the eprm/risk conference
Division after two and a half very happy years. I am however still at risk
Waters group, where I am now working as a journalist on eprm magazine.
Future conference enquiries should go to paul bristow (us - 212 925 6990) or
Frances tully (europe - + 44 (0) 20 7484 9731).
Many thanks for your work my events and I hope we can work together again in
The future. If you have any ideas on the writing side then I would always
Appreciate a call or email - my contact details all remain the same.
Best regards,
Joel.
