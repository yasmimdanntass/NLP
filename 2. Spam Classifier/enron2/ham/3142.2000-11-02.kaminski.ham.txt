At the notes recently I found that I am missing some sections (e. G. Optimal
Techniques for measuring var, using monte carlo techniques to accurately
Calculate var, evaluating the impact of volatility and extreme values on
Var). Would you be able to send me a copy of your notes, as I am about to
Embark on a var modelling exercise and I am sure they would be very useful.
