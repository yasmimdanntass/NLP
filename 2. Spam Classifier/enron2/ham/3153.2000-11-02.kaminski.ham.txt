Margaret carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with nesbitt.
Vince will check with ena to see if they also want to attend. I would also
Like to determine if ets and/or nbp would want to send a representative (s),
Although margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other
Key players as necessary. We should ask nesbitt how he would structure a
Deal for multiple clients (eg. Ets, nbp, ena, and maybe el paso).
[we need to remain aware of any" affiliate" issues that may result, and make
Certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]
I will wait until after our meeting with nesbitt before deciding if/how to
Approach el paso. Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the
Cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.
Jng

John,
I talked to dale nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his
Model is to
Go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his
Company.
Our cost is a flat fee of $12, 500 that would be deducted from the purchase
Price of $55, 000,
In case we buy the software package.
The price of 55 k is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required
Level of support.
Dale will be in houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit
With us on tuesday,
November 7, at 3: 00 p. M. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.
Please, let me know what you think.
Vince
