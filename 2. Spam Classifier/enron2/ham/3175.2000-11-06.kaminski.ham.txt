Dear vince,
I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding grant masson. You informed me
That he is no longer an enron employee. I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.
I am inquiring because infocast would like to have an enron representative
Speak at an upcoming conference entitled" power crisis in the west: status
It is certainly
Going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy
Surrounding
The situation in san diego.
Kind regards,
Nia mansell
