Subject: amitava' s visit
Really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the
Quantitative work we have undertaken. As you are aware much of the work
Requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the
Significant contribution that amitava' s experience and expertise has provided
In a very short timeframe.
As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated
Support from someone with amitava' s background. It is imperative that we
Leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights
Into our project. This will not only speed up the work considerably but also
Ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.
I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure amitava is more
Integrated into our efforts. I realize it will be difficult to free him up
But maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.
Some early ideas:
Have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support. This
Should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant
Effort for the project and then continue with amitava a full time ec. Com
Resource working from houston. This is likely my preference.
Or
Agree a schedule of regular trips which allows amitava to provide critical
Insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract
His experience on an ongoing basis.
Let' s discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities
Thanks for your assistance.
