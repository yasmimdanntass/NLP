Steve,
Rac will be a bit unhappy about it. I think that bjorn will object to it.
Let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it.
The question is how to present it to rac in a such a way that
Rodrigo will not be put in a bad light.

HI vince
I' ve had a chat with rodrigo lamas, who is a bit unhappy in his current role
In rac (he wants to be a bit more proactive, and finds the inertia
Frustrating). I would be very interested in bringing him into research with
Responsibility for var/risk mgt, which is where his professional experience
Lies. He also has a phd in optimization from imperial college london which
I' m sure we can make use of.
There will obviously be some political issues involving such a move only 4
Months into his career at enron, and if you' re able then i' m sure he' d
Appreciate a chat with you.
We' re awaiting your response before rodrigo mentions this to anyone else.
Steve
