Dear mr. Kaminski:
It' s a great pleasure to have you visiting us and a great honor to have
Dinner with you. I' d like to thank you for your wonderful presentation. It' s
The most interesting topic we had so far. This is not just my personal
Opinion, all my classmates I talked to agree with me. I like enron' s style
And culture and I think it played a big role in enron' s success. I look
Forward to discuss career opportunities at enron during your on - campus
Interview session.
Regards,
Frank qian
