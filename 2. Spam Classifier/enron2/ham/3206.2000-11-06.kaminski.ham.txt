Vince,
I wanted to email you and let you know how sorry I am that I was not able to
Make your presentation at carnegie mellon. I really was looking forward to
The trip and the presentation but unfortunately since I have been on the road
A lot lately things started backing up in the office. After my meeting on
Thursday there was no way I would make the 6 pm flight and my original flight
Would have put me in pittsburgh to late for the presentation.
Anyway, I hope you understand and I am looking forward to working with you in
December for the interviews on campus. Maybe once you return you can give me
A recap of the days events. In the meantime if you need any assistance
Please do not hesitate to call.
Thank you,
Kristin gandy
