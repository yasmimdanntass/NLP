Vince,
I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above
Group last friday. I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more
Options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain
What that effort looks like? One of the global markets traders, mario de la
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.
Thanks,
Kevin
