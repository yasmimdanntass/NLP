HI kevin,
Brian wood with avistar is going to be here next tuesday (11/14). I have
Asked him to schedule some time to meet with you and vince, and whomever else
Needs to be trained. I was not aware that you would be using the media
Server, so I didn' t arrange to have him spend any time with you when he was
Here alst. I' ll let you kow what time (s) he' ll be available next tuesday.
Sorry for the delay
Ian - - please ensure that vince kaminskI is set up to use the media server
Thanks!
Paige
