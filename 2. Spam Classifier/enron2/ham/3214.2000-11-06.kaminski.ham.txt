And mr. Goodpasture for next tuesday. I believe it was set for 300 pm this
Coming tuesday at your offices. (I seem to have misplaced where I wrote the
Specific time, so I wanted to be sure to reconfirm.) please confirm if you
Get a second so that I can finalize my travel schedule. You can email or
Phone 650. 218. 3069. Thanks. I look forward to meeting with you again and
With mr. Goodpasture.
