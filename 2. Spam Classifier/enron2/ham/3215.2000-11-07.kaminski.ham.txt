Subject: ethylene margin collar simulation model
I set up the simulation model. The margin follows a mean - reverting process.
I seperarted the data into two category, margin > 0. 04 and margin < 0. 04.
Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets.
I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data
Set.
The high mr speed surpresses the probability at high payout side.
Since the mr speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so bob will run
A few senarios.
I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium
Calculation, so the
The result in el 8 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal
Pricing.
I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar
Worth.
Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread
Option
Approach that bob and lee set up.
Look like we got a reasonable model.
Stinson:
I' d like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.
Lee and douglas:
You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.
Bob:
We need run different price curve senarios using the simulation model.
Plus different mr speed.
