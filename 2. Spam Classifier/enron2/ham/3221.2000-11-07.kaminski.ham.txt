Subject: contstraints on the shape of a smile
Stinson, vince, zimin,
Here' s a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed
Expiry date.
The constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case.
I' ve used a template created by dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary.
If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a
Little bit more about it.
I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e. G.
Stochastic volatility and local volatility models
Will throw up different constraints.
Steve,
I am not sure if our traders (or quants for that matter) are aware of these
Constraints
And some desks are beginning to build smiles...
Regards
Sharad
