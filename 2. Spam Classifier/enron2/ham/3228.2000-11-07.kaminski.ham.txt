Thanks for the update, vince. I have been trying to discuss this with you
For several days, but I know that you have been very busy. Jaesoo told me
That he wanted a base of $90 k rather than the $85 k which you had authorized
Me to offer him, and I told him that I would have to discuss it with you and
Get back to him. I am glad that he has seen his way a little more clearly,
And I will call him tomorrow to finalize the offer.

Dear dr. Kaminski
First of all, I would like to thank you for the offer from the enron.
I really appreciate it.
Molly and I talked about the salary the other day, but to be honest with you,
I' m pleased with the possibility that I can work there where I want to work
And the salary is the next.
If this matter bothers you, please ignore it. I can accept the original offer.
I' m looking forward to seeing you soon.
Sincerely,
Jaesoo
