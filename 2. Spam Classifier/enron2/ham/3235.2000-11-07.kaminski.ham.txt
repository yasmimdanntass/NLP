Vince,
Good morning.
Further to our conversation thereon during your austin visit 10/11, I am
Writing at this time to inquire whether we might schedule a circa 7 p. M.
Dinner next wed. 11/15, to include the participation of your enron training
Arm colleague. We could then discuss ut partcipation in enron training
Activities, as well as the forthcoming spring 2001 conference.
Best,
Ehud
