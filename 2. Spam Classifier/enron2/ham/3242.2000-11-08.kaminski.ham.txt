Subject: super saturday participation and off - cycle interview request
Thank you for volunteering your time for this weekend' s super saturday. We
Appreciate your commitment to enron' s recruiting success. At this time we do
Have an adequate number of interviewers and will not need you to sacrifice
Your saturday. However, as last minute changes occur in the interview
Schedule we may have to contact you for back up.
Although we are in good shape so far for saturday, our off - cycle recruiting
Department is looking for interview volunteers for the following dates:
Thursday, november 9 th from 9: 00 a. M - 12: 00 p. M
Thursday, november 16 th from 9: 00 a. M. - 12: 00 p. M.
Thursday, december 7 th from 9: 00 a. M. - 1: 00 p. M.
Over 50 candidates will be interviewing over these 3 days. The candidates
Will be a combination of associates and analysts representing schools such as
Princeton, harvard, university of north carolina, notre dame, university of
Illinois, emory and many others. Each candidate will have 4 interviews.
Pending the outcome of their interviews we will invite them to stay and
Attend super saturday that weekend. If for some reason we decide not to
Further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home that friday morning.
We are asking enron employees manager level or higher to volunteer at least
One hour to interview candidates (you will see two candidates in that time).
If you can volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the
Stated dates, that would be great! Your help is needed! Please contact
Cathy lira, at cathy. Lira@ enron. Com or x 54049 as soon as possible, if you can
Volunteer any time for interviewing.
Thanks again for your participation in the associate & analyst programs.
