Vince: I will send to you later today the information you requested in
Electronic form; in the meantime, please discuss with jeff shankman. He just
Alerted me that he has procured the required funding and that jeff skilling
Has agreed to enron joining the webI at the corporate partner level. I am to
Call jeff shankman later today to discuss.
This is great news for the school and enron!! Would not have been possible
Without your persistance and assistance and I thank you for it.
We will discuss more later.
