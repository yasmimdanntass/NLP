Subject: webI proposal
Vince: per your request, I am forwarding the electronic version of the webi
Proposal. As I mentioned to you yesterday, jeff shankman has procured funding
For enron to join at the corporate partner level, so you may wish to discuss
The matter with him prior to circulating this document. This funding is in
Addition to that which you and christie have already committed to other
Research and sponsorship activities at the school.
Please let me know if I can be of any further help. I look forward to seeing
You again soon.
By the way, I cast my vote on time and with no confusion; let' s hope the
Outcome is as we hoped it would be.
