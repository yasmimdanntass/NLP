Subject: margin collar
I wanted to give you the status on the bp margin collar deal. We submitted a
Bid to bp yesterday where bp would pay enron just under $5 mm to assume the
Contract. We have yet to have further discussions, so there' s not much more
To report than that. We greatly appreciate your help on this project. I
Feel like we put together a very good bid, and measured the risks
Appropriately with limited time. I will keep you informed of how the
Negotiations proceed.
Thanks again,
Lee jackson
