Bryan,
We shall be glad to take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor
Provided system we
Have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will
Have no objections to it.
Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the
System you want to buy
With the rest of var/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this
Endeavor.
An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be
Rolled into the existing risk systems.
Vince

Vince/steve - - we are going to the board in december to ask for formal
Limits. As you know one of the key limits at the board level is value at
Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our
Approach for calculating var. We have implemented a third party risk system
Which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt
Positions in. The system has a var engine which is being demo' d by the
Vendor today. Ben and kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the
Technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the
Module. Pls. Let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would
Envision implementing.
Thanks
