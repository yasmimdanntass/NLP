Subject: final version of the presentation
George,
Here is the presentation. I wasn' t able to add a table showing the
Distribution of bids by fuel type for april 2000 since the database is not
Updated. Also, in the map I didn' t make those minor changes. Because when i
Try to erase those names, the map looks ugly. When I get back from california
Let' s get together and discuss the feedbacks from traders.
Sevil,
