Rick and ted,
It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding
Chicken houses.
I shall send a message to bryan saying that the research has to look under
The hood and examine the mechanics
Of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not
Sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve
The model should not be left to ben and kirstee.
Please, let me know what your thinking is.
Vince

Vince/steve - - we are going to the board in december to ask for formal
Limits. As you know one of the key limits at the board level is value at
Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our
Approach for calculating var. We have implemented a third party risk system
Which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt
Positions in. The system has a var engine which is being demo' d by the
Vendor today. Ben and kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the
Technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the
Module. Pls. Let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would
Envision implementing.
Thanks
