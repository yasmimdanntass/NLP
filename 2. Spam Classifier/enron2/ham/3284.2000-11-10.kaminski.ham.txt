Ken,
Either is really fine with me. I' m glad to have you coming. I will be out
Of the office on nov. 21 and the 22 nd is likely to be a short day for most
People, so starting on nov. 27 would probably work the best for us.

Stinson,
I have talked with folks here at fn, and I am happy to say that may be able
To start at enron as soon as monday november 20, the week of thanksgiving.
I am in the process of wrapping up my existing projects, but it appears that
Things are coming together well, and I may be able to leave a little earlier
Than I had thought. Would you prefer that I start the week after
Thanksgiving?
Ken
