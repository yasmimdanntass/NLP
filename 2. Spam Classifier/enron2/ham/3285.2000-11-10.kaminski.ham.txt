Subject: hiring at a vp level
Jeff,
I want to bring aram sogomonian back to enron at a vp level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
A support of three senior executives.
I want to ask you to express your opinion on aram (based on a phone interview
Or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to norma
Villarreal at h/r.
Thanks.
Vince
