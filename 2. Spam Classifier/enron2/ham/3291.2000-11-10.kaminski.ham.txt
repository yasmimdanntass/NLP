Gentlemen,
I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3
Power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~$15, 000).
Lance cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it
Very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this
Recommendation.
Vince

Vince,
We have three options to increase our availability across enron for the power
World load flow software.
Option 1, upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price
$9, 990. 00
This would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows, but not
Determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (atc) because only the
Optimal power flow (opf) version can perform that task.
Option 2, site license for the load flow and purchase 1 opf package for
Walter coffer' s group. Price $11, 240.
This would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows and one other
Group the ability to determine marginal cost and atc.
Option 3, site license for load flows, opf and atc. Price $14, 990. 00
This would give all of enron the ability to perform load flows, marginal
Cost, and atc.
Regards,
Lance
