Subject: vince,
I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
This year. When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
You asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
Your group. Although I didn' t at the time, now I do. This student has
Excellent technical skills, including an m. S. In statistics
And a ph. D. In economics by the end of the current academic
Year. His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
Of independent power producers in the us. As a result of research
Assistance he has done for me, he knows the california market very well
And is familiar with the other isos. I think he would be an excellent
Match for you. The only problem is that he will probably have many
Other options available. However, I definitely think he' s worth a look.
If you' d like him to send you a cv, please let me know. Thanks.
