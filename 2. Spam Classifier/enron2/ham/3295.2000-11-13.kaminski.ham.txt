Vince,
I quite agree, we have to separate out price and position,
And that is what we have done with the historical simulations/evt ideas. We
Have taken today' s delta - gamma, hold that frozen, and gone back historically
And looked at price changes and see what happens to portfolio changes.
Garman and company have looked at gross historical portfolio changes, which i
Agree is not the best approach, due to the artificiality imposed by largest
Net open positions (nop), such as we have seen recently.

Tanya, naveen,
Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes
Of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas
Portfolio. A big jump in
The volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price
Movement may produce an
Observation that looks artificially big.
If the volumetric position was frozen, it' s just a scaling factor and there
Should be
No discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
Is to separate the price process from the position changes.

Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic
Process to model the behavior
Of commodities' prices in our var model. So what I do care about is the
Behavior of log - returns.
Any help is appreciated.
Tanya.

Tanya,
We care about portfolio value changes, not log - returns of a
Single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a
Fat - tailed distribution. A 1. 20 basis move, with 500 bcf position, is an
Extreme event, anyway you slice it. In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree
For a single contract log - returns, they don' t divide by vols.
Regards
Naveen

Naveen,
I got ngI - socal prices for prompt, prompt + 1,..., prompt + 59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log - returns as
Well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log - returns:
[return (t) - ave (t)]/vol (t)
And compared the results to normal distribution.
I could not find fat tails!
Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
Log - returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large
Returns more frequent than normal),
Which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).
