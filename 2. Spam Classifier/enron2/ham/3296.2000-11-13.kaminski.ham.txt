Eric,
I have a number of case studies on enron but not the one on sutton bridge.
I know that peter tufano was working on it but when I checked the hbs
Site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it.
When I talked to peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was
Ready
And he was going through enron' s internal approvals.
I cc mark palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.
I wander if it was completed, given sutton bridge developments.

Vince -
Where might I find copies of the case studies enron has published? I' m
Particularly interested in the sutton bridge publication for havard but would
Like to know if there is a library of case studies.
