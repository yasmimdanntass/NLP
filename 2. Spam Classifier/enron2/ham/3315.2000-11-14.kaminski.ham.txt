Subject: the next newsletter
Good morning, vince!
As I will be on vacation (tomorrow until monday the 27 th), i' m enlisting
Elena chilkina' s help in producing this monday' s (20 nov.) newsletter.
Here' s how I hope it will work:
I' ve asked alex huang to try to get his article to you by friday for your
Review.
I' m attempting to get with sharad today to get his photo and remind him about
The bio piece for page one. He should be the feature for monday.
I will also schedule a person and an article (probably from charlie weldon)
For the 27 th. If alex' s article is a two - parter, we' ll just do part 2 that
Day instead.
For all submissions for this coming monday' s issue, I would ask that they be
E - mailed to elena chilkina
If you notice something I may have missed, would you please let me know?
Thank you!
Sam
