Rick,
I asked greg whalley and he declined (he has a speaking
Engagement in london a day before).
I have sent an invitation to louise kitchen and she has not
Replied yet. I shall catch her at the management conference in san antonio
And
Ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well.
