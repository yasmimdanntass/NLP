Vince,
We have not started our spring hiring yet. However, we will review and let
Him know we have an interest and tell him when we will be interviewing on
Campus. Thanks
Althea and shelly,
Please keep track of his resume so that he is considered for a summer
Position when we begin the spring recruiting. Thanks
