Subject: good morning
Vince,
Attached you will find a draft" thought document" based on our
Conversations yesterday. I think that it captures much of my
Recollections. Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me. In
The next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a
Successful conclusion and a draft by christmas.
Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
In whatever ways you think appropriate (don' t be bashful - - I want us to get
This right).
Have a great day.
Your friend,
John
