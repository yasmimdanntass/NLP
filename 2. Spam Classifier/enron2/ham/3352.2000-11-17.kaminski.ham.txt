Subject: eol wtI maket maker simulation model
Stinson,
I add the total p/l due to contract rollover. When the number of trades is
Large
And the spread is not too small, the model prints a lot of money, dominated by
Those trade earning the half of bo spread.
I also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page. I think we
Are
Ready to deliever the model v. 1.
The next step is to incorporate the intra - day market movement by using high
And low
Prices into the pricing. I will call you on monday.
Happy thanksgivings!
Zimin
