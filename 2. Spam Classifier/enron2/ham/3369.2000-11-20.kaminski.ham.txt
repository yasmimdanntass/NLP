Good afternoon. I have forwarded your email to kristin gandy. She is
Heading up our cmu recruiting effort. Some contact info: (713) 345 3214,
Kristin. Gandy@ enron. Com
We are very interested in the comp. Fin. Students, and would tentatively
Like to interview them in december, probably the week of the 11 th, and around
The same time that we come to interview the mba' s.
I' m uncertain as to the proper path forward. Could you provide some details?
Regards,
Kevin kindall
