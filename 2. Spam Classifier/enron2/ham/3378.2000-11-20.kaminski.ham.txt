Subject: personal time on tuesday, nov. 21, 2000
Shirley:
Just a reminder that I had requested time - off on tuesday, november 21, 2000,
To attend a school function that I attend every year for a little friend of
Ours. I know you will be on vacation but leann will be here to help vince
Or any of the rest of the department. I would not normally take off when you
Are gone, but this is really important to riley and I hate to disappoint
Him. His school has grandparents day the tuesday before thanksgiving every
Year. He does not have grandparents that can attend so he has always asked
My husband and I to come as his special friends. Usually, al could just go
Alone but as you know he is in hawaiI taking care of his father and will not
Be here tomorrow. I have worked enough extra hours to cover the time I will
Be off (9: 00 am to 1: 00 pm or 1: 30 pm). I appreciate your consideration and
Thanks in advance if we can work this out.
Anita
