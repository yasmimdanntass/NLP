Subject: re: tage resume submittal
Vince,
Thanks for forwarding the resume. We have generally had great success with
Ex - koch people.
He sounds might like he may be a good fit for michael l. Miller in principal
Investments. At this point
I have very recently inherited two other stron vps from eI and therefore will
Probably focus on a few
Manager and associates for the near term but I would like to keep james'
Resume for further opportunities.
He sounds like someone we should at least meet with and figure out a spot
Within wholesale services.
What do you think?
Regards,
