Subject: phone interview
Per our conversation yesterday, I will have a job description for the comp
Finance students sometime today. I have also gone through the mba resume
Stack yet again. The person who requested the phone interview is troy
Mischke. He works for pratt & whitney in florida. Cmu has a flexmode
Program, which is another phrase for distance learning.
It turns out that there are a number of people that work for pratt & whitney
In florida. My guess is that they all know each other, and decided to take
The flexmode program together. Here are the names
Tony garcia
K. Todd kuykendall
Timothy leonard
Troy mischke
Only troy requested the phone interview, although tony gacia did send a
Cover letter. What is the best path forward?
