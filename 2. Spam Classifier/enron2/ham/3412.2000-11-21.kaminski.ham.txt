Sir,
I just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2, 200 k. This is net of
Corp charges and intercompany billings. In order to get to this number, we
Have to reduce your budget by 83 k. Do you have any suggestions in which
Category (ies) we need to reduce?
Budget 10, 521, 000
I/c billings 8, 238, 000
Subtotal 2, 283, 000
Per delainey 2, 200, 000
Need to dec by 83, 000
Here are my suggestions based on oct expenses:
Category oct expense budget decrease yearly amount
Periodical/subscription 5, 200 10, 000 3, 000 36, 000
Tuition and reimbursement 11, 000 21, 000 4, 000 48, 000
This will bring you to the bottom line suggested by delainey. Please let me
Know your decision by november 21. If you have any questions, call me at
5 - 7094. Thanx.
