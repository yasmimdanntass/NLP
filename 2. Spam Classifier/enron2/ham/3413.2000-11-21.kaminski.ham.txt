Subject: re: letter to nesbitt
Vince,
Your note looks good to me, short and to the point.
I assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with dale. I would
Want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model
And database for north america. Unless a familiarity with the short term
Model is a prerequisite, I doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on
It.
Depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term
Model, it might be helpful to have access in both omaha and houston?
We would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need
For testing the model. Steve hotte, cio for ets, would co - ordinate the
In - house installation for us. At some point, it will be helpful to get steve
In contact with the appropriate marketpoint it rep.
Assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues, dale should
Probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review.
Let me know what I should do next.
