Subject: visit to houston
Vince,
I hope things are well with you and your family.
The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in houston
Next
Week between monday and wednesday inclusive. If there is an opportunity to
Meet
Up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing
Activities
In the areas of strategy, value and, increasingly, real options.
If you are attending our energy symposium, or can meet up, please contact me
At
Your convenience. If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
Our senior managers from houston: george e. Danner. George is a member of
Our
Us national strategy team and part of our global network of specialists
Working
On real option pricing.
If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy thanksgiving.
Allan
