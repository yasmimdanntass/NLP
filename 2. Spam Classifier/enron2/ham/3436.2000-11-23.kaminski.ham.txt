Subject: re: f/u to dr. Kaminski@ enron from iris mack
HI again,
Thank you for your email. Sorry for the phone tag and email tag. I will
Try to call you again next week.
In the mean time, I thought I would send you a couple of documents to give
You an idea of some of the work that I have done that may be of interest to
Enron.
1. The first word document is my london busines school executive mba
Thesis relating to weather derivatives.
2. The second word document describes a hybrid derivatives structure I i
Workded on at bnp paribas. It has applications to the enerygy industry.
Because these documents are very large I will forward them in two separate
Emails. Your comments on them would be appreciated.
Happy thanksgiving,
Iris
