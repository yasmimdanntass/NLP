Dear vince,
I am sorry for the dely in answering. These are their phone numbers:
Ernesto hernandez: (713) 532 - 0573
Carlos gorrichategui: (713) 668 - 0408.
The best way to get a hold of them at this point would be through
Me. I would pass along the information and then they can contact you.
Cheers,
