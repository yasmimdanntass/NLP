HI samer!
Hope you had an enjoyable thanksgiving!
I found out the" scoop" on the ticket. It was non - refundable and non -
Refundable tickets cannot be transferred. It was just your seat that
Maureen' s husband used.
I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330. 50.
The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
The check from us.
Sorry for the confusion!
Cheers!
Shirley

Subject: american express charges
Shirley,
How are you? Things are fine over here. We are still trying to settle in;
This process seems to be taking forever.
I would like to ask for your help. I have received a statement from
American express related to my enron account. The charge amount is $330. 50,
Which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket. After calling the travel
Agency in the park, I found out that this was the ticket that I was
Supposed to have used to fly to colorado. However, the ticket was used by
Maurine' s husband and maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket. Also, i
Remember calling the tap and cancelling prior to the travel date. Can you
Help me figure out what is going on here? I am not sure who is supposed to
Pay for this. I disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected.
I appreciate your help. Thanks.
