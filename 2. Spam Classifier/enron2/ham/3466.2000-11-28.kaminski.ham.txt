Vince,
After checking into this issue I have found that the type of information
Requested is proprietary and not available for release. I will try to
Contact them and see if there is something else we can help them with but as
Far as the data is concerned I don' t believe we can help them with that
Request. I am sorry I couldn' t be of more help. Thank you.

Support
The growth of this market and part of the process is development of the
Infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.

Dear sir:
The scientific computation group at the university of
Waterloo, ontario, canada, has recently started to be very
Interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
Market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
Offer challenges from the modelling point
Of view.
However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
Data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
We would like to know for a given city pair for the different
Existing type of lines (e. G. Oc 3, ocl 2, oc 48....)
1. What has been the spot lease prices (e. G. $/ line - type/mile) for
The past 12 months?
2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?
3. What is the maintenance cost $/ month?
(for the same lines, e. G. Oc 3, ocl 2, oc 48,...)
4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
(e. G. How much does it cost to upgrade)
Oc 3 - - > ocl 2
Oc 3 - - > oc 48
Ocl 2 - - > oc 48
5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
Capacity to another (e. G. 1 month, 2 month,...)?
We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
Data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
Was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Yann d' halluin
