Subject: re: telephone interview with the enron corp. Research group
Ms. Crenshaw,
Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
Opportunity to talk to personnel from the research group at enron. Between
The two days you suggest, I prefer wednesday 12/6. Considering the
Two - hour time difference between california and texas, 11: 00 am pacific
Time (1: 00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
Of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
Please let me know.
Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
Colleagues.
Jingming
