Vince:
It was stewart myers, head of the financial engineering track. He did not
Contact me directly, he contacted josef (an mit student that spent the summer
With enron and received an offer to come to work with us).
Josef wanted to know who could make the commitment of sponsoring (sending the
Problem).

Subject: mit financial engineering pro - seminar
Vince,
I have received a call from mit asking if enron would be interested in
Sponsoring a financial engineering pro - seminar.
This means that enron would propose a problem that would have its solution
Developed by students in the financial engineering track. These students
Would present the findings in the end.
I think that enron has already sponsored a financial engineering pro - seminar.
I remember something about real options at the time I was at school.
Please, let me know if enron has the interest, specifically the research.
Talking here at the weather desk, mark tawney expressed interest. If you
Agree, we (the weather desk) could co - sponsor this pro - seminar with the
Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to weather
Trading.
Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.
Thanks,
Claudio
