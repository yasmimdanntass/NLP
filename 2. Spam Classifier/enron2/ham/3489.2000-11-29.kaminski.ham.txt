Your
Flight will be on time... Although having watched 60 minutes last night and
Suffered from a #of delays lately, let' s hope that the" weather blame"
Doesn' t get in the way. It' s best to leave me a message@ my usual work #
On thurs., 914 253 4187,... I can easily check it in houston.
I' ll be staying@ the westin oaks in the galleria... Any preferred place
That I can book (& for what time)?? Coming over to down town won' t be a
Problem for me either.
Will be great to see you again.
