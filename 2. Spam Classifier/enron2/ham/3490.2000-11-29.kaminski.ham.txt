Interview to see if there is a fit and an interest, we will schedule an hour

Let me know.

When you come into the enron bldg, go to the security desk and ask

Dear shirley crenshaw,
Thank you very much for your interest. I will be in
Houston tomorrow morning and I thought that it could
Be more convenient if we can meet in person. If you
Prefer the phone interview, let me know what number i
Should call and we can have it tomorrow.
Thanks again,
Nina knirel
