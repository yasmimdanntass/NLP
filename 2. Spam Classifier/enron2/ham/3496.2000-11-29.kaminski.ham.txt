Hi, mr. Kaminski:
How are you? I hope you had a wonderful holiday. I just came back from
Chicago.
There is an enron on campus interview at cmu scheduled on 12/11. Is this
The interview for our class or for mba students? I am concerned because i
Was not selected for this interview, and I would like very much to have a
Chance to talk you about what I can do at enron.
Frank
