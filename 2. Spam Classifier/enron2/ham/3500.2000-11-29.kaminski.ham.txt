Subject: re: enron tiger dinner
Donna,
Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. I would appreciate if you could
Coordinate
The dinner with the students and the faculty. You can expect 4 persons from
Enron but the
Restaurant should allow for some flexibility, just in case. If the restaurant
Needs a credit card number
Or a security deposit, you can refer them to my assistant, shirley crenshaw
At 713 853 5290.

I look forward to seeing you and jeff shankman next week in regard to the
Enron tiger kick - off meeting scheduled for wednesday, dec 6 in vance hall
210 from 3: 00 - 5: 00 pm.
You mentioned possibly wanting to take the group to dinner after the
Presentation. I would like to recommend the palladium restaurnat, which is
On locust walk here on campus. You may want to view their website at
Www.. Com I think they have a nice menu and can
Accomodate large groups. There are several menus from which to choose, as
Well. Please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you
And I will notify the students and faculty.
Please let me know if I can assist with your visit in any way.
Regards,
Donna piazze
