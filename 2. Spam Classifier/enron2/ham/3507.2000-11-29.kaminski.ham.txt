Subject: interest in a position
Dear vince,
When we talked last, you mentioned you were considering making additions to
Your office staff. If you are still considering these additions, I would
Like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me. It would be
Wonderful to work with a group such as yours.
It has been great working in recruiting, but the time has come for me to try
Something else. I am beginning to look around, but wanted to talk to you
First. If my skill sets match a position you might be adding, please
Consider me. I have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what
I have done.
Thank you for your consideration. Have a great thanksgiving!
