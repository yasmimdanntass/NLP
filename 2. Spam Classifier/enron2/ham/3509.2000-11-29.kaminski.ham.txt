HI helyette,
Congratulations on your papers.
The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals
(it' s circulating through different parts of the company
Where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute
The contract in the first few days of december.
I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

Dear vince,
I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show
In paris. In my case, it is the same: I got 3 papers accepted in the
3 major journals in finance (journal of business, journal of finance
And journal of financial economics). We should write a piece!
Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people. My
Lawyer had added a paragraph to karla' s document: since she had
Mentioned the right for enron to check at any time the code source
Etc, he wanted to request enron to pay his fees in the case d - g
Disappeared. In any case, if you are still interested, we are ready to
Use your escrow account to make things simpler. Moreover, I am
Striking an agreement with a software company, 13 years with
People from polytechnique + finance, to be our hot line (with us paying
Royalties, of course). This would complement my 2 associates.
Looking forward to hearing from you
Helyette
