Subject: jason sokolov' s removal from ted murphy' s cost center
Norma:
Ted murphy would like to have jason removed from his cost center
Effective december 16 th. Vince said that it would be ok to have him
Added to our cost center, effective that date. He is not supposed to start
With the research group until the 28 th, but needs a home from the 16 th to
The 28 th, so we will pick him up.
Can you take care of this?
Thanks!
Shirley
