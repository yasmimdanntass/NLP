Subject: update/event time change
Thanks to everyone for attending the meeting today!
Event time change!!!
I just spoke with the office of the chairman and have learned that ken and
Jeff are actually available during the morning of december 19 th from 8: 00 am
Until 11: 00 am. As a result, our plans have changed just a little and I have
Requested whether or not they are willing to pose for polaroid pictures with
Employees - i' ll let you know what I find out! We will still have the jazz
Duet and informational poster displays in the lobby throughout the day and
Instead of dessert items, we' ll order breakfast stuff.
Assignments/budget!!!!

Next meeting to determine what purchases need to be made - budgets will be
Discussed at that meeting. Again, it will be on wednesday, december 6 th from
