Subject: re: project tracking database access
HI sandy:
Yes he does. Actually in our group meeting today, vince kaminskI said
That he wants most of his group to have access. I believe stinson gibner
Is working on the list. Is there a way we could submit a request to
Incorporate
A list of people to give them access? They would need writing access also.
Thanks!
Shirley

Shirley,
The default access is read only. Does this person need more rights, i. E.
Editor?
Thanks,
Sandy
