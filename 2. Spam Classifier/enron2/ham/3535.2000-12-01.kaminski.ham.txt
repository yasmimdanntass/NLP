Subject: career opportunity
Dear mr. Kaminski,
?
I will forward my resume. I am looking for a trading position. I have three
Years of market - making experience in illiquid markets, which I beleive is
Highly relevant. But it seems now that getting out of my contract is not an
Alternative anymore.? I learned yesterday that my firm finally decided to
Grant me what I wanted... A new desk. Sometimes I feel that when you become
A trader you come to trade everything, including your career.
?
? I thank you for your time and consideration.
