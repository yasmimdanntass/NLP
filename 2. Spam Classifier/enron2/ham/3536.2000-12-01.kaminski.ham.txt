Subject: interview with enron
Dear mr. Kaminski,
?
Even though I cannot pass" official" interviews, I would like to discuss
With enron. I was really impressed by your presentation and I think I would
Be a good fit for your firm.
?
I know that you? Will be soon recruiting on campus, maybe we could set up an
" informal meeting". Either give me a call at home (412 - 802 - 6429) or send me
An email at this address. I would appreciate though not to appear on
Interview lists.
?
Pierre - philippe ste - marie
