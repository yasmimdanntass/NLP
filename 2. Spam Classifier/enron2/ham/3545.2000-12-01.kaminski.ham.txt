Subject: grep for windows.
Folks,
Those of you who have used unix are probably familiar with the grep command.
It' s used to extract lines from a set of files that contain a given input
String, and is very useful. (if you have any questions on how to invoke it,
Ask me.)
The grep command is now available in a pc version - - see below.

Todd and joseph,
As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been
Ported to windows. I did some research and was able to find the windows
Ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that
Contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any
Further assistance. Thanks.
