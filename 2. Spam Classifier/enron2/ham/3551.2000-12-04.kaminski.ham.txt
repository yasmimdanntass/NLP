Subject: enron wholesale services legal department
As a follow - up to the recent enron corp. Memorandum forming enron wholesale
Services (ews), effective today, we have reorganized the wholesale services
Legal department.
The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows: (i) align the
Legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed
The flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve
Greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.
To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for ews legal, which will
Include lance schuler, enron americas; mark evans, enron europe; mark taylor,
Enron net works; alan aronowitz, enron global markets; julia murray, enron
Industrial markets; and bruce lundstrom, enron global assets.
The organization chart for the ews legal department is attached. More
Comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.
