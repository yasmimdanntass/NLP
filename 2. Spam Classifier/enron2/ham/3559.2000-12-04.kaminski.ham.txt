Enron supports employees' involvement in civic organization
And I think you should continue tour involvement with lwf.
It' s important that we give something back to society.
You don' t have to take a day off to attend workshops.

Subject: my involvement in leadership fort worth
Vince,
I am currently a candidate member of leadership fort worth through august of
2001. I don' t know if you are familiar with leadership houston or any other
Leadership group, but it is basically a civic organization that provides a
Forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for
Civic leadership. For their first year, members are candidates and must
Attend about 1 full - day workshop a month in fw, normally on a thursday.
After that, members can transfer to other leadership cities. I talked with
Stinson about the group and he thought I should talk with you about whether
Or not I should stay involved with lfw. The attached email describes the
December meeting scheduled for 12/14. Thanks
Ken
