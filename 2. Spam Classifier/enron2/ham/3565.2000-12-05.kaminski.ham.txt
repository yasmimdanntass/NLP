Vince: update on charles shen: he called me this morning to verify that we
Had received his faxed paystub. I told him that we had, and that I had
Relayed the information to you, but hadn' t heard back from you yet. He is
Definitely interested in working for enron, and ended up saying that he
Didn' t mean to be demanding and really only wanted a package a little better
Than the one he has at williams.
I told him that I would follow up with you to see where you wanted to go from
Here, and that I would get back to him as soon as I received some
Instructions from you.
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything else or find out any
More information from him.
