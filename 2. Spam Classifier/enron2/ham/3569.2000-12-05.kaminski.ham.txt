Vince,
Following your espeak session, erin rice suggested I contact you about
Joining your group. I have been with ees for almost three years, and during
That time I have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on
A larger scale. Specifically, I excel at analytical/quantitative problem
Solving and the development of models and user requirements for application
Development. My educational background is energy management, and I have
Recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions. I have
Attached my resume for your review, and I hope you will call me so we can
Talk in person.
Thank you.
