Vince:
Did you get the below email from jim garven?
Would you be able to stay over and speak at the risk management fraternity
And perhaps come in a day early and speak to his students?
Shirley

Dear vince,
Since we last corresponded, I have left lsu and am now professor of finance &
Insurance at baylor university in waco, tx. My colleague at baylor, john
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, february 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule
Might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our
Dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of gamma iota sigma, a national
Risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be
Available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on
The previous day (thursday, february 22)? What I have in mind is a
Presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my lsu
Classes.
Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to
Seeing you once again.
Sincerely,
Jim garven
