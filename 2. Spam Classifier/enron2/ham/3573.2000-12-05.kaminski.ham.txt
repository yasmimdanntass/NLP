HI vince, I already spoke with maureen and we discussed timing. Yana will
Stay until a replacement is found and trained. As for the permanent
Transfer, that is not a problem. Thanks for getting back with me.

Andrea,
It' s fine with me. Few points:
1. As a courtesy to maureen raymond, please, discuss the timing with her.
2. Yana is not a member of the analyst/associate pool. This is not a rotation.
She was hired directly and this means that we transfer her
Permanently to your unit.
Vince

Start date in eim of dec. 18 work for you? Please let me know.
Once again, thank you for your support.
