Subject: derivative classes
I discovered that clewlow and strickland have at least two books,
" implementing derivative models," and" exotic options." I gather that" exotic
Options" is the one you intend to use in your class, correct?
By the way, I queried participants in my class, and I heard that the case
Study approach we occaisionally used was appreciated by several. The var
Class I taught was from jorian' s book, which has no exercises and which
Assumes a particular background in finance and statistics. I created a
Problem (not exactly a case study) that required participant to learn some
Statistics and try some different approaches. From this, participants got a
Better idea of why one bothers with certain issues. Some liked the" real
World" flavor of this kind of approach. (without the case approach, you could
Provide good counterexampes as a partial remedy.)
Best regards and season' s greetings,
