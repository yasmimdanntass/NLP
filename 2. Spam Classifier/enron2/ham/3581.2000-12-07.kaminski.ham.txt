Volatilities calculation
Winston,
I am sending you the documentation on the new methodology for creating ffvols
From implied vols. This methodology requires some minimization procedure
To fit the given vol curve with a smoothing function. I am sending you the
Code I wrote that performs minimization with simulated annealing method from
Numerical recipes.
We might need to discuss some details. Please, let me know if you have
Questions.
Tanya.
