John,
It does not sound silly to me. I don' t get that many opportunities to sit
Down
With those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat.
I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from
Philadelphia and have to catch up with a few things.

Subject: good morning
Vince,
I know that you are in philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my" first
Pass notes" before I leave town in the morning. Please edit/add to or
Delete anything you think is appropriate. My objective in the notes is
Just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed. When i
Place something in quotes this indicates a direct quote.
I' ll give you a call next week when I get back to town. Thanks again for a
Truly memorable experience. I plan to frame jeff' s enron model. It may
Sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
Like the one I got on monday. What a truly spectacular day.
Take care,
John
P. S. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
But I wasn' t able to get him to sign it. I hope I did not offend him by
Asking for his signature on that silly graph. After I left his office it
Occured to me that he might think I was making light of him. Please
Explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as
Capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset.
