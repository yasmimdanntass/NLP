Subject: re: suggestion: implementing var based on non - normal log - returns
Simulations
Everybody,
We were talking for a while about using non - normal distributions in the
Monte - carlo simulations in our var model.
I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under
O:\_ dropbox\tanya\non _ normal _ logs. Doc
Look through this 3 page document, and let me know what you think, please.
