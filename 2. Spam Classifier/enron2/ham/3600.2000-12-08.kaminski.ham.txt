Vince -
I am with the ebs venture capital group. We are looking at evaluating an
Investment in a company called widevine out of seattle. Part of their value
Proposition involves certain patents on genetic programming. Are you familiar
With that? If so, can I set a meeting with you and a few other members of my
Group to discuss on tuesday or wednesday?
