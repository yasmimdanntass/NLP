Worthty.
Here is the list that I have already, approved by vince.
If there are any additions please inform me a. S. A. P.
The deadline is december 12 th, as I will be meeting with the
Owner of floral events to confirm the order and treat him to
Lunch for all the great work he has provided for me.
Thanks
