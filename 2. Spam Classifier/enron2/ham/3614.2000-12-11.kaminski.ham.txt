Vince -
George just" remembered" the traders' meetings monday and wednesday
Afternoons at 3: 30. He' s going to email you - I think tuesday would ensure a
Turnout of traders as well as analysts. We could easily have 20 people there
From power alone, and there' s always gas.... When you decide the time, can
You ask shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30 cl?
