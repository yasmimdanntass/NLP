Subject: default rates
Please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse. I
Have placed mark ruane' s yields against a mid november default frequency
Table. Note there may be a slight shearing in dates, but the concept is
More important:
Market implied cumulative default rates (%):
1 year 5 year 10 year
Aaa 0. 51 5. 74 14. 54
Aa 0. 67 6. 39 16. 61
A 0. 98 8. 98 21. 03
Bbb 1. 17 9. 88 22. 39
Bb 3. 27 18. 62 37. 51
B 4. 65 24. 21 46. 27
S & p historical default rates (%):
1 year 5 year 10 year
Aaa 0. 00 0. 13 0. 67
Aa 0. 01 0. 33 0. 90
A 0. 04 0. 47 1. 48
Bbb 0. 21 1. 81 3. 63
Bb 0. 91 8. 82 14. 42
B 5. 16 20. 95 27. 13
In looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
Many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981 - 1999)
Historical default rates (%):
Investment grade non - investment
Grade
Avg. 1981 - 99 0. 07 4. 21
1991
0. 12 10. 40
Multiple 1. 7 x
2. 5 x
Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
Default rates to obtain a" multiple" (how much more severe than historical):
1 year 5 year 10 year
Aaa infinite 44. 2 x 21. 7 x
Aa 67. 0 x 19. 4 x 18. 5 x
A 24. 5 x 19. 1 x 14. 2 x
Bbb 5. 6 x 5. 5 x 6. 2 x
Bb 3. 6 x 2. 1 x 2. 6 x
B 1. 1 x 1. 2 x 1. 7 x
On the 10 year historical figures, we need to be careful as the s & p static
Pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably
Due to prepayment) versus our contracts. Secondly, the s & p figures have
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some
Information content.
I will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would strongly suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful
Of the right people so that we can step back and design the right
Architecture for looking at credit in our deals. It is broken, not clear,
Killing our velocity and true capabilities. We also need to look at staffing,
Skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at
An agenda.

I visited with vince kaminskI for about 20 minutes today regarding the market
Implied defaults rates and the disconnect in investment grade land. He is
Seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the
Methodology employed in calculating the implied figures. I will follow
Through and report back.
