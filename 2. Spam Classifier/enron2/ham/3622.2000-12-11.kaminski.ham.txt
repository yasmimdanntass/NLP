Subject: recommendations
Vince and joe,
This is just a short reminder about the four letters of recommendation.
I have attached an envelope with each recommendation. Once you
Seal each envelope, please don' t forget to sign it (over the adhesive
Seal) and to label the front, e. G." columbia - joseph hrgvocic". Also,
I will be mailing everything in one package to each university, so
Please don' t mail them out.
That is all. As always, I really do appreciate the time you' re taking to
Do this.
Thank you,
Hector
