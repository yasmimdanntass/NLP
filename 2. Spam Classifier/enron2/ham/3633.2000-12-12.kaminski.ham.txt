Vince, zimin,
I participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning. There
Was a possibility enron would invest in it.
Their product appears to be a guI interface over the top of ilog solver (and
Possibly ilog cplex) which allows problems to be expressed in high level
Terms. I do not see any immediate application at enron, but I am interested
In the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo. Maybe it would be
Useful for general modelling projects here.
They do not even have a user manual for their software, so it will be
Difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged. The
Possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ilog software is a
Modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that
Market. I think the scheduling tools in sap, I 2, etc are more likely to
Succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information
System.
Because of the small market for this software, the many competitors, the
Absence of any clear use for it at enron and the early stage of development,
There is very little prospect of us funding this company.
