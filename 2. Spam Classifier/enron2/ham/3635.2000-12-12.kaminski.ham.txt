Andreas,
Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Subject: garp 2001 convention
Dear garp 2001 speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
Garp 2001 convention, which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp 2000.
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention. Delegate
Bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As a result, we are
Set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention earlier this year.
The three workshops and the one - day asset management forum are also very
Well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of course
Provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
December, so that I have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
Delegate pack for the convention. (given the break of the christmas and new
York period, and that the event is being held in new york, I am sure you can
Appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to be taken
Into account, hence the reason why the presentations are required as soon as
Possible). This is purely for reproduction, we also request you bring your
Presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy disc or a
Laptop.
?
2. Audio - visual requirements: can you please inform me of what audio - visual
Requirements you may have (35 mm slides; ohp; lcd projection - notably
Powerpoint).
?
3. Check list: I have attached a check list for your information. If you
Have not returned this already, can you please read and fax it to my
Colleague, claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact me,
Otherwise I eagerly await your response in due course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in new york in february.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
