Subject: joao neves
Dear vince:
?
I am in a somewhat delicate position. One of the people in the group here
Has asked me to introduce him to you.? As an el paso vice president, i
Should not have agreed to do this, and frankly, the guy should not have
Asked.? But he is clearly very unhappy at el paso, so, as a human being, i
Felt it was appropriate. Also, because this guy would have contacted you
Anyway, with or without my introduction, as a professional courtesy, I would
Like you to benefit from my experience with this fellow.
?
The guy' s name is joao neves (portugese).? I think he is reasonably bright
And seems to have a quite deep understanding of general finance and
Financial mathematics. He is a manager and feels very frustrated because he
Had hoped to be promoted to a position of authority. Instead the group' s
M. D. Brought in two price - waterhouse - coopers consultants as v. P' s to run the
Structuring and quant sides of the group. In this respect, I can understand
His unhappiness. Unfortunately for him, however, I also think it is in his
Nature to whine.? I have observed him to bad mouth lots of people starting
With the it guys (ok, that' s perhaps not much an indictment!) all the way to
Dismissing broadie & glasserman' s or eduardo schwartz' works as shoddy or
Shallow.? He does not seem to suffer well people he considers fools.? Caveat
Emptor, therefore! Having said all this, I do want to emphasize that he is a
Bright guy, is very pleasant with me, and, perhaps given the appropriate
Environment and supervision, might be quite productive.? But don' t take my
Word for it. Talk to him, and see what you think.? Obviously, I would ask
That you keep these comments in confidence. I have given you an honest
Assessment - - brutally so.
?
' nuff said! I have fulfilled my moral obligations both to joao and to you.

Best regards,
Grant.
