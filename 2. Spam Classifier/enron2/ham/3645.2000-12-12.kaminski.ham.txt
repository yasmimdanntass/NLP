Subject: follow - up meeting on wharton
It seems like several of you will be on vacation next week, so lets see if
We can do it this week. Vince is available on thursday from 2: 00 - 3: 00 pm
Or friday, from 1: 30 - 2: 30 pm.
Do either one of these two times work?
Let me know.
Thanks!
Shirley
