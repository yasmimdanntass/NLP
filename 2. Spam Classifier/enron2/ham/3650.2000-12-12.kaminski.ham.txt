Chris,
I have read the paper. It reads very well. Two comments.
1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard gbm simulation
Equation and
The way it' s typically discretized.
2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain
What ct is (perhaps a footnote).
I am also including a message I sent to julie today.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in
Houston):
A. Paulo issler
B. Alex huang
I shall attend the course on weather only.
2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5, 000 aud for lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2 nd installment comes from the budget
Of our
Office in australia. I shall talk to paul quilkey today about it. Please, let
Me know if there is any delay.
3. The book will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at
Rice.
Rice univ bookshop is placing an order.
4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the best
Way to place the order? Can we pay in us dollars?

Best regards.
Vince
