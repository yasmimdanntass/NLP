Daron,
We are not yet finished with jeff' s presentation, and probably won' t be
Completely finished until tomorrow afternoon - just about the time that
Jeff will leave for dallas. In addition, e - mailing the complete
Presentation may not be an option due to the size of the file.
I' ve asked hamd to e - mail you want we have right now so that you can test
It with your system. We' ll then send a cd with the entire presentation
Along with jeff to dallas. I' ll ask jeff to deliver it to you at the
Dinner wednesday evening, so perhaps your av people can test it that night.
Daron, I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have
Another idea as to how to handle this situation, we' re certainly willing to
Entertain it.
Thanks, srs
