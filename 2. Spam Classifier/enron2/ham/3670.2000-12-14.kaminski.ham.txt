Dear vince
Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
Two - day garp convention. Unfortunately, it is not garp' s policy to allow
This for a number of reasons: garp is a not - for - profit organisation, will
Much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other
Conference organizers. Garp' s mission is to allow an educational forum for
Furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
Networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However,
In an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a
50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in enron. This
Will be for the two - day convention and will include the gala awards evening
On 13 th february, which had over three financial and risk professionals at
Garp 2000.
I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of
This, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering
Note referring to this e - mail, and I will ensure that our administration
Depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do
Not hesitate to contact me.
I look forward to your response and to meeting you in new york in february
(and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).
Kind regards
Andreas

Andreas,
Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Dear garp 2001 speaker
This is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
Garp 2001 convention, which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
February, 2001.
Thus far, garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp
2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention.
Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As a
Result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
Earlier this year. The three workshops and the one - day asset management
Forum are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I
Will of course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
The event.
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few outstanding issues:
1. Presentations: can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
December, so that I have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
Delegate pack for the convention. (given the break of the christmas and
New york period, and that the event is being held in new york, I am sure
You can appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to
Be taken into account, hence the reason why the presentations are required
As soon as possible). This is purely for reproduction, we also request you
Bring your presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy
Disc or a laptop.
2. Audio - visual requirements: can you please inform me of what
Audio - visual requirements you may have (35 mm slides; ohp; lcd projection -
Notably powerpoint).
3. Check list: I have attached a check list for your information. If you
Have not returned this already, can you please read and fax it to my
Colleague, claire as soon as possible.
If you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact
Me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due course.
I look forward to seeing you in new york in february.
Kind regards
Andreas
