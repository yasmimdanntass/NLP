Subject: my students
Dear vincent,
I spoke with my students yesterday and they told me they have thought
About coming to see you again, and they think it' ll be much better in
The future when they are closer to completion of their ph. D. I think this
Is a very sound idea, but I wanted to give them anyway the opportunity
To see the actual working environment at a place like enron. They are both
Very serious and responsible, so they feel they had better go see you when
They would be in a better disposition to give more of themselves to enron.
They are both superb students and very hard working individuals, so I do
Hope you will consider checking them out in the future (within a year -
Year and a half).
I will contact you and/or stinson in the future when they are closer
To finishing up.
Best,
Carlos
