Dave,
No problem. I shall do it this weekend.
Also, I left you a message regarding grant masson (a vp in my group
Who left and went to work for el paso 2 months ago).
I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He
Wants to come back
After 2 months.
My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite
Competent.
I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other
Side
Of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay." the
Return of grant
Masson" would demonstrate that enron offers best long - term growth
Opportunities (and that
I am good manager).
Grant would come back to his original vp position. Can we short - circuit the
Hiring procedures for a vp. Grant' s body is still warm and we can just
Re - instate
Him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required
To hire a vp.
Vince
