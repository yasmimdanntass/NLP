Subject: wtI models
Stinson and vince,
I finalized the presentation for john lavorato, he said he is ready
To present it to greg. He is happy with the work we provided.
I will be on vocation starting next week. I attached the simulation models
Here in case that you need them. The oc version deals with open - close
Trading and cc version deals with continuous trading.
Should you have any questions, or need to run different scenarios, please
Call me at home. Otherwise, I will see you next year.
Merry chrismas and happy new year!
Zimin
