Debbie,
We asked dba to refresh stage this monday.
It was refreshed on thursday. Jin is running vatrfacs today (friday) to
Create correlations and factors.
Then, according to our plan, we will ask ramesh to run var on these inputs.
We will send the inputs to you to run var in the spreadsheet and reconcile
The results for uk.
Tanya.
