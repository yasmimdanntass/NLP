Subject: dpc memo
Vince,
I am in houston (rrived satruday), and will be in office on monday (though
Officially, I am on vacation). Would like to catch up with you if possible.
It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the dpc
Side. I have already made a recommendation to wade.
I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to wade on the dpc position
And possible workout. This is still a draft and will likely get shared later
With others. I would love to get your comments on the same. At the same
Time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with
The other plan presentation I had sent you.
Look forward to touching base with you.
Regards,
Sandeep.
