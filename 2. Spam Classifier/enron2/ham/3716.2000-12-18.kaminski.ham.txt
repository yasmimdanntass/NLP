As I am sure you are aware, we are facing significant challenges with the
Dabhol project. As I have delved into the project and our problems, I have
Been disturbed by our lack of information/data relative to our position in
The grid and the overall fundamentals for the region. I would like to meet
With you and get your assistance in identifying some resources to try and
Help the india team develop a better understanding of their market and how to
Identify/develop/use the fundamentals.
Thanks.
Jim
