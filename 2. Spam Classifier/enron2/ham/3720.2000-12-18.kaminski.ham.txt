Patricia,
I have forwarded your resume along with an introductory note to kerry
Cooper, don fraser, and malcom richards of the a & m finance department.
Please give them a phone call and tell them that I suggested you call.
They are all very nice folks and would be happy to help you I am sure.
Good luck,
John
