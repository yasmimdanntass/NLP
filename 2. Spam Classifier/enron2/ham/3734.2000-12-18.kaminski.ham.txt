Frank,
We shall have about 30 people, highly technical (ph. D., m. S. Level).
A presentation of 45 minutes would be optimal, assuming you may arrive
Around 11: 45 - 12: 00.
We shall get the projector for you.
Please, keep all the receipts for refund.

Excellent, vince! Yes, I will be happy to make a presentation. Do you have a
Projector to which I could simply hook up my laptop? Could we also have an
Overhead projector as a backup? Many thanks, frank
P. S. How long is optimal? How large an audience and what are the
Participants' backgrounds?
