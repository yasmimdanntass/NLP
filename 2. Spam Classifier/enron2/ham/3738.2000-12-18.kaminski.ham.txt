Christian -
I was thinking that your expertise in grads and grib formats will help
Enron to obtain
A competitive edge over our competitors. Development of the grads
Visualization tool
Will allow our international offices to obtain the mrf (medium range forecast
Model) data first,
Without being dependant of internet sources. Additionally, I think that we
Could obtain
Mrf ensemble data via the same sources as well.
Can we include in the agenda the development of these tools?
