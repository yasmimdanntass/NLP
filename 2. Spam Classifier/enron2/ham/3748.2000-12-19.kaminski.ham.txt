Becky,
The charges to corp. Go to rac and are based on my projections of expected
Expenses.
The charges are based on the following assumptions (percentages in the
Parenthesis show
Amount of time allocated by each person (group)) to rac:
1. Value - at - risk group (var)
Md (25%)
Vp (60%)
Director (100%)
5 managers (100%)
2. Enterprise wide risk management
Manager (100%)
Associate (100%)
Currently we hired (or will shortly hire) 4 managers for the var group. The
Expansion of the var
Group was planned based on the requests from rac for more support.
Vince

Becky,
I am discussing these allocations with the appropriate groups within
Corporate, as they will be the ones accepting/rejecting these charges. I am
Forwarding this to the appropriate individuals within the corp. Departments
For their review. So, do not consider corp as" in agreement" until you hear
Back from me. I also reviewed what we are receiving in 2000 and I have a few
Questions relating to both 2000 and 2001:
1. What is esource?
2. What is ena ops direct?
3. What is ena occ direct?
4. What is ena co 021? Is this vince kaminsky' s group? The charges for 2000
Have been about $16 k and $20 k to the rac group, so at that rate, I would
Expect 2001 to be no more than $250 k - $300 k, but the plan amount you sent is
$1. 9 mm. I will need some detail on this.
Thanks,
Steve

Attached is the 2001 preliminary inter - company billing. Ena will be billing
Plan numbers for all departments except for external legal and external tax,
Which will be billed base on actual. A quarterly review will be done to
Determine the variance between plan vs. Actual amounts. If the variance
Amount is material, we will adjust the billing to your business unit
Accordingly.
If you have any questions, call me at 5 - 7094. Please review this billing,
And notify me with any questions by wednesday, december 20, 2000; otherwise,
It is assumed that you agree to the intercompany billing from ena.
You are the only person in your business unit receiving this invoice. If
This invoice needs to go to someone else in your business unit, please
Forward to the correct person and can I be included in the forward e - mail?
