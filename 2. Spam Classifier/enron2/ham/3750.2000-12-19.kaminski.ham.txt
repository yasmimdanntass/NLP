Gail,
I have attached several emails which have the following items:
1. HawaiI 125 - 0 docs
2. Economic summary that includes a summary of all assumptions in the model
3. Models
4. Asset summary
The following is a structure diagram:
Please let me know when you would like to meet to discuss these items. Also,
Alan quaintance is the person who reviewed the hawaiI 125 - 0 docs, so if you
Have any questions regarding those docs, you will probably need to meet with
Him.
Thank you!
