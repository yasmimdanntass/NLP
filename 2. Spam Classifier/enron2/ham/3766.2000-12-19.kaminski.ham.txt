Vince and jeff... The following is" fyi"... My assistant is working on the
Flight arrangements. Also," fyi", the doubletree and other downtown hotels
Were entirely, or mostly, sold out, but my assistant found a good rate at the
Warwick [$115] by herman park, where everyone will be' housed' in the same
Location for one night - - I also think this location is a good' houston - sell'.
Dinner is scheduled for 7 thursday evening at churrasco' s, and my group is
Arranging the" tourenron" - - breaking this group into 2. [fyi: the energy club
From smu (another skilling alma mater) had long ago also schedule a tour that
Day, so we' ll have 19 from smu and 18 from wharton on the same day... But so
Far, all seems manageable.]
As" tour times" are set, and business unit interview requests are received
From the students, i' ll keep you posted.
Thanks!
