Vince,
I appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
Last. However, my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
And I wasn' t sure I would get back to this before leaving tomorrow. The
Only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
Plus the addition of" unused information" at the end of the document. The
Unused stuff is made up of notes I made from hamel, some news stories,
Press releases, and random thoughts. We probably won' t use any of this
Stuff but I wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful.
The challenge we face at this stage (and where I can most use your help) is
In documenting enron' s risk management functions in a meaningful way. This
May be best done through examples or in some other way. I think that our
Audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
Examples (even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don' t
Interrupt the flow of the article. If you' ll make a pass at what you feel
Is appropriate i' ll gladly polish on the words as I try to learn about what
You are doing myself.
Vince, I really am enjoying this learning experience. You guys make a
Wonderful" lab".
Sally and I are driving to louisiana to pick up her mom tomorrow and then
Driving to new orleans and back to waco by saturday. However, I will check
In my e - mail regularly.
Your friend,
John
