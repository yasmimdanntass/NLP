Ehud,
Best holiday wishes to you and your family.
I owe you an apology for dropping the ball on the conference
I have approached a number of executives at enron. Greg whalley speaks in
London a day
Before. Louise kitchen, the mother of enrononline will skI (this is the week
Of school holidays in england and her family will come here).
One suggestion I want to make is rick causey. I talked to him and he is
Willing to
Be a speaker. He is a very senior and important executive of enron and a ut
Grad.
Any thoughts?
