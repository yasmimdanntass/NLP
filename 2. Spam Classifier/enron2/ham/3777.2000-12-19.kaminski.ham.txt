Subject: today' s gathering
Hello, vince!
I was planning to stop by damian' s this evening, but I think i' ll go home
Instead. I' ve contracted a sneezy cold, and I don' t want to spread it around
Anymore than I already have.
Thank you for putting this together. I' ll have to make the one in january
For sure!
Sam
