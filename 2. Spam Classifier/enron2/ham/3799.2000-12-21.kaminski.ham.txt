I will make sure you get on this distribution list.
Credit is going to be a big issue for energy companies and banks.
We may need to form additional discussion groups.
Volatility in energy prices and a general economic slowdown may cause an
Increase in defaults.
Banks are primarily interested in regulatory impact on loan portfolio and
Credit derivatives as a an alternative to raising capital or selling assets.
Energy companies could use credit derivatives to hedge or price credit
Exposure.
Don mumma (ex csfb, md axiom software) is organizing a survey of energy credit
Practices. You can reach don at 212 - 248 - 4188 ext 22.

Dear members of the credit derivatives group.
You' ve probably been wondering if I would ever get the minutes of last weeks
Meeting out. Well, here they are and I sincerely apologize for the delay. I
Always thought this time of year is supposed to be slow, but unfortunately,
The opposite has been the case.
Please pay particular attention to the action points. We can only handle
These meetings successfully if each and everyone of you actively
Participates and plays a role! The next meeting can only be scheduled if
There is enough feedback available.
Wishing you happy holidays,
Regards,
Jeannette
