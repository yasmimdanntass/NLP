Christian,
Just finished meeting with pual, vince & mark
New plan:
Let' s plan on your coming to houston march 12 th - april 2 nd (after our
Summer/winters respectively
But..
Let' s proceed with the project without pause:
1. Please send up the software that needs to be installed along with
Operating system requirements
2. Please copy me on forecasting provided to sydney office on a daily basis
If we work on these two fronts, it will optimize your time here and permit
Transotion to cover your forecasting there
Thanks
