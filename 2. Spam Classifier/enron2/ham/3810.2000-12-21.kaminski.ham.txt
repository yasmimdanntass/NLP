HI mike,
Thanks for the message.
Here is one more reason why we should have our own in - house modelling:
The pcmdI nwp weather maps have been discontinued
The pcmdI wxmap web has been discontinued starting 20 december, 2000
Please see the u. S. Navy wxmaps at...
I will shortly forward a set of minimum requirements (hardware...), softare
Has been written by me, with some public domain software.
I am thinking of setting up an internal website with model output data, and
Verification info.
Cheers,
Christian

Christian,
Just finished meeting with pual, vince & mark
New plan:
Let' s plan on your coming to houston march 12 th - april 2 nd (after our
Summer/winters respectively
But..
Let' s proceed with the project without pause:
1. Please send up the software that needs to be installed along with
Operating system requirements
2. Please copy me on forecasting provided to sydney office on a daily basis
If we work on these two fronts, it will optimize your time here and permit
Transotion to cover your forecasting there
Thanks
