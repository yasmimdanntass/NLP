The gas and power trading organizations have had a tremendous year.
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization
That significantly contributed to that success. I believe the weather group
Comprised of mike robert' s, jose marquez, stephen bennett and dave ryan from
Power are one of those groups. These individuals have done a tremendous job
Of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take. The
Greatest achievement has been the november and december winter forecast.
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were
Moderating. On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve
An" a +". When you are down on the 32 nd floor it would be nice if you would
Stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our
Success.
Thanks, jim schwieger
