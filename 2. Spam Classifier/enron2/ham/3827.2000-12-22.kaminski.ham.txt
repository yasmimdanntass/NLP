Vince,
How are you? I apologize for not contacting you earlier. We bought a small
House and it is consuming all of our time. We also adopted a little puppy
Which proved to be a lots of work. Believe it or not, I have not had the
Chance to visit ny city yet (I was there once briefly to drive to the
Airport).
I just received the check for the airline ticket. Thank you for taking care
Of this issue quickly. Shirley was, once again, superb. Take care. Hope you
Have great holidays. If you happen to be in the ny area, please let me
Know. Perhaps we can have lunch or a drink together.
