Vince -
I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the
Weather satellite dish - what a gorgeous view of houston!).
I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, vince. You are my" father"
Here at enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind
Of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high
Standards you set for all of us in your extended" group."
I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn' t
Appreciate the way maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external
Factor in their success - it is not simply their own abilities that matter to
Their futures but your own - vince' s - success with upper management that
Matters.
We respect you, and we don' t like it when you are disrespected. Maureen
Didn' t disrespect me today, vince, she disrespected you.
It' s time I told you something. Last april, maureen, highly intoxicated
Following a work - related function at ninfa' s, made an unsolicited predatory
Sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19 th floor. I was shocked and
Disgusted, but I didn' t say one word about this, vince, because I played it
Out and didn' t want to put you into the position of having a raving maureen
In your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of
Gender - bias crap lawsuits.
I" took one for the team," vince. I can' rt say I would do it again - maureen
Is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.
I appreciate your bringing me into enron. I' ve found a respectful and,
Indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to
Help the group.
Clayton
