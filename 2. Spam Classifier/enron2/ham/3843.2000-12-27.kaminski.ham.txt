Subject: projects update
Vince,
A quick project update.
1. Sandeep and I spoke with robert schenck in adelaide. He will email a
Henwood proposal to us. They already figured that we must be interested in
Modelling dabhol.
2. The wtI eol trading simulation had an error. We were counting a
Mid - offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread
On each round - trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close). I
Modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to greg whalley (he is the
One who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and john
Lavorato. I should probably re - run the earning volatility numbers, and
Update ted murphy as well.
