Stinson,
Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model.
It seems that our work will make an impact on eol trading, that is very
Exciting.
Could you e - mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with
The changes you have made?
I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes
Book, I finished the entire book. The queueing theory is very fascinating,
And hopefully we can apply the theory to a real ebs project.
I will take my family out to see the nature bridge caverns near san antonio
Tomorrow.
See you on tuesday.
Happy new year!
Zimin

Greg,
Here are results corrected for spread profit per round - trip transaction.
Prior results incorrectly counted a spread profit per trade.
