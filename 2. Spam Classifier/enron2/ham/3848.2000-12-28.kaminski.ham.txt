Subject: seasonal factors and curve fitting
I have written a c + + code to do the following: for a given curve,
The code will filter out the seasonal factor. It then fits the deseasoned
Curve to a smooth function of the form f (t) = a + a/(t + b) c, with 00, which is useful in calculating forward - forward? Vol.? The outputs are season patterns (2 different patterns are allowed)? And the smoothed curve. One can then calculate forward - forward vol? From the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back? Onto the curve.?? This procedure is not useful for var calcuation. However, I believe it? Is useful for other situations which require the knowledge of seasonal? Forward - forward vols. For example, in power plant valuation and? Credit exposure simulations, it would reflect the reality more closely? If we add seasonality to our forward - forward vol in simulating the forward? Prices.?? Attached are the spreadsheet and xll file. I will forward the c code if? Any of you is interested.?? Alex??
