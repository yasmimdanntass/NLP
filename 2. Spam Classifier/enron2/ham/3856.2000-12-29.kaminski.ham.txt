Vince, sorry, the files from that directory get deleted periodically. I
Attached this file here.
RabI did some analysis related to implementation of correlated non - normally
(rtdm - distributed)
Variables. Let' s discuss later?

Everybody,
We were talking for a while about using non - normal distributions in the
Monte - carlo simulations in our var model.
I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under
O:\_ dropbox\tanya\non _ normal _ logs. Doc
Look through this 3 page document, and let me know what you think, please.
