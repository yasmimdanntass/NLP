Subject: eol wtI historical trade simulation - more profitable trading
Strategy
Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some
Typos.
Greg and john,
I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of
Trades (keeping the
Total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable. This is partially
Because in a trending market
We lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose
Market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10, 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread
Is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
Trades of short positions, the total mtm for that day is
(- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1) * 10, 000 = - $150, 000 and total trading
Volume is 50, 000 bbl short. If per trade volume is 50, 000 bbl, we take one
Trade, the total mtm is
- 5 * 50, 000 = - $250, 000. Thus the net difference between the two trading
Strategies is $10, 000 for that
Particular day.
Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the
Number of trades, we can be more
Profitable as a market maker.
I rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec. 27 where he used per
Trade volume of 30, 000 bbl.
I reduce the number of trade to 10, 000 while increasing the number of trades
By factor of 3. Almost in all
Cases, I saw increased profitability. See the colume marked" change" for
Dollar amount change in millions.
Please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this.
