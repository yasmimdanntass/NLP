Stinson and vince,
Please see wade' s comments below. It is critical that we start the exercise
Quickly, and as metioned, it should be structured so that dpc foot the bill.
Also, as mentioned, please have them desist from using the word viability
With reference to dabhol.
Regards,
Sandeep.

Thanks sandeep. Engagement needs to be structured so that dpc will pay for
This key study. Have them address the study to dpc and invoice dpc.
Second, on the cover, the reference is to"...... And dabhol plant
Viability." please instruct them to immediately cease discussions about and
Use of term dabhol viability. They can use the term they use later on, which
Is dabhol plant operations.
