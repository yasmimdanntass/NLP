The $1. 3 trillion tax cut which is frequently quoted by the press is over 10
Years, the $460 tax cut below is over five years.

I looked into the proposed tax cut by george w. Bush. On his website he
Proposes a $460 billion tax cut over five years.
The $213 billion" energy tax" imposed from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy
Prices, is roughly half of bush' s proposed tax cut.
