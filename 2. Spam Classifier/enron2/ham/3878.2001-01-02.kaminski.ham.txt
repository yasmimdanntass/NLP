Subject: mike roberts
John,
I have received your message regarding mike roberts. I could not
Agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
Contribution.
Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
Should be consolidated under mike (including the weather guys supporting
Power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove mike from
Power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.
