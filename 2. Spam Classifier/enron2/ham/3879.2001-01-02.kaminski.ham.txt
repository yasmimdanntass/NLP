Subject: allocation schedule
We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names
And projects that research is working on for various bus. Can you tell me
How you are doing on that? Sarah brown, my manager, had a meeting with corp
And they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1. 9 m).
Their argument is that they are going to bill ena back anyway; therefore,
They have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001,
Which is approximately $760 k. If you have any questions, please call.
Thanx.
