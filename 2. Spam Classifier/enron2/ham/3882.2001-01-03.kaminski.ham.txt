Subject: benchmarking study
Sally,
I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for enron' s participation.
What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what' s
Going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the
Project.
My recommendation is to forget it.
Vince

Dear vince,
Peter nance and I wanted to follow - up our discussion of enron' s participation
In our benchmarking study. Have you discussed enron' s participation in the
Project with your colleagues?
Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive
List of over 700 metrics. The study group will decide which metrics to use.
With eei' s credibility and teknecon' s technical expertise, we intend to
Become the industry standard in benchmarking. We would very much like to
Have enron participate in the study.
I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with
Peter nance if you think that would be helpful.
Best regards,
