Subject: the garp convention
Dear shirley
?
Further to our telephone conversation earlier today, I am writing concerning
The garp 2001 convention, which will be held in new york between 13 th and
14 th february.
?
I have set a new deadline for presentations to be sent to me, which is
Friday 5 th january. I am sure you can appreciate that collating, arranging,
Organising and printing over 80 presentations is a mammoth logistical task,
Hence why I require the presentations as soon as possible.
?
Can I please have an indication of when I am likely to receive vince' s
Presentation? Below is the talk he has agreed to give (he has also agreed to
Chair the stream on energy & corporate risk on tuesday 13 th february):
?
Measuring energy risk - tackling price volatility, adapting var, scenario
Modeling and regulatory requirements
- mean (or floor) reversion
