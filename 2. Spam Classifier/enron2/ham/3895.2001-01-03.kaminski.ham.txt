Subject: meeting with petronas
Rick,
I was contacted by petronas who requested a meeting
With enron on risk management. I have met with them
A few years ago and they want to discuss with us
Their progress implementing risk management practices.
Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for
Banks
(you or david port, bill bradford, research)?
Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on thursday, feb. 8,
At 10 a. M. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.
I shall also contact jeff shankman and john nowlan
To arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.
Vince
