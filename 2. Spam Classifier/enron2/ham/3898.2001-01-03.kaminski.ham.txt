Subject: re: cross - guarantees
Attached are the latest drafts of 3 of the cross - guarantee agreements. I
Have the other nine as well, in case you need them. The agreements are
Basically identical with one exception. The debt to enron in raptor 3
(approx. $259 mm) is excluded from the guarantees. You may also note that
This debt is not represented on the dprs which I sent earlier. This is
Because the formation of raptor 3 was a failed fas 125 transaction, therefore
We did not get sale treatment and can' t recognize the debt in looking at
Credit capacity. Let me know if you have questions or if you need the other
Nine guarantees. Thanks,
Ron
