Subject: raptor position reports for 12/28/00
Attached are the latest available daily position report files for the 4
Raptor vehicles which include spreadsheets detailing what is hedged within
Each vehicle. One thing that I forgot to mention in our meeting yesterday is
That there is considerable indecision as to whether or not raptor 4 will be
Included in the cross - guarantees, so we will need to have a value with or
Without raptor 4. I will send a follow - up e - mail with the latest drafts
Available for the cross guarantees. Let me know as questions arise. Thanks
Again.
Ron
