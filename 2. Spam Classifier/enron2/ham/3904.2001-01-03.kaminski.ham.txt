The books were set up incorrectly when the spreadsheet feeds were
Implemented. This has since been corrected. Currently the european risk trac
Numbers do not feed into the corporate reporting of var.
The books should now contain gas exposures in uk gas and power in uk power
And have no duplication.
I have previously discussed with naveen and kirstee that it would be a good
Idea if we set up a regular meeting to projecct manage the implementation of
European var numbers, from risk trac, into the daily reporting. If you have
No objections I suggest we discuss this at the next weekly rac/research
Meeting.

David and vince,
In my e - mail below I pointed out to a inconsistency in the portfolio
Hierarchy for uk positions in risktrac that I found out,
Namely: some books (for example elsb 1 and elsb 2) belong to uk - gas portfolio
And to uk - power portfolio.
I wanted to clarify this in order to reconcile positions in risktrac and in
The spreadsheet.
Tanya.

Naveen and matthew,
I started looking systematically through uk positions and corresponding var
Numbers in the risckrac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.
1. The portfolio elsb 1 - nbp has a book elsb 1 under it. The sum of delta
Positions for this book is
239, 021, 655, the sum of gamma positions is - 211, 031, 450. Var for the
Portfolio elsb 1 - nbp is zero.
The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example elsb 2 - nbp, elsb 3 - nbp,
E 2 xxl - nbp.
2. The portfolio elsbp 1 - ppp also has the book elsb 1 under it. This book
Contains the positions on pppwdl
Through pppwd 6 and pppwel through pppwe 4.
The same refers to the other books, for example elsb 2.
This looks messy. Can someone in rac go over all the portfolios, all the
Corresponding books and curves
In risktrac and make sure they are set up properly?
Thank you,
Tanya.
