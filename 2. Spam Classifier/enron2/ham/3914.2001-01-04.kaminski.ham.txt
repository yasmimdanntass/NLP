Subject: ca for henwood
Bruce,
Evidently your assistant was unsuccessul in finding the ca' s used in either
The of the previous henwood projects for japan and korea.
We are working on a project to model the economic viability of dabhol under
Economic dispatch and are faced with a very tight deadline in february. Can
You help us put together a confidentiality agreement for henwood energy
Services, inc. Who will be performing the model calculations?
Any help would be appreciated.
Regards,
Stinson gibner
