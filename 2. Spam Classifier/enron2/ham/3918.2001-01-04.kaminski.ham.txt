Subject: follow - up on captive generation
Vince/stinson,
Please find below two attachemnts. The excell spreadsheet shows some
Calculations on the savings from using dabhol power as against a diesel
Genset operating at a higher heat rate. There is also a differential in
Price of diesel, as against naphtha used by the plant. I have taken data
From the septemeber bill of dpc. We do not want to give the actual numbers
To the press, since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent/kwh
Energy price of dabhol that is reflected there.
The seond attachement (word) has the wordings that I think we can send in to
The press. Please review the calculations and the note, ad if you find this
Satisfactory, please forward to jeff/s.
I am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications. The number
(610 mw) for total captive generation in maharashtra) is taken from mohan
Gurunath' s presentation on this.
Regards,
Sandeep.
