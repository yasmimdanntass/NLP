Subject: invitation... Welcome new analyst reception
Hello vince
I wanted to forward the following invitation to you. We are putting the
Technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the
Analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have
Scheduled on jan. 16 th. I wanted to forward to you as more of an fyI since
We do not have any cal berkeley candidates starting on jan. 8 th. Also - we
Are starting to set some of the events on campus for the spring - so we
Should probably get together soon. Please let me know what works best for
You!
Thanks,
Ashley
