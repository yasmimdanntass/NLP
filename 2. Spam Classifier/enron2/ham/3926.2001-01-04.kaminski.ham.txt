I can attend. Do you know any of the details of the tiger team project and
Who they are working with? Also, names of the students would be helpful. So
We can see if any are applying for summer positions.

Hello team,
I hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season.
Down to business: the university affairs group is putting together a tiger
Team of students to do a project for enron. Those students will be in town
On january 18 th and will be having dinner at churrasco' s that night. I think
It would be a great opportunity for some of the wharton alum to come out and
Meet the participants, talk about enron and eat some good food.: -) if you
Are interested in participating please rsvp to me via email or at extension
53214 no later than 1/5/01.
Thank you and hope to see you soon,
Kristin gandy
