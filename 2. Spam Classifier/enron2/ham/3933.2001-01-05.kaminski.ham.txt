Subject: analysis of dabhol energy cost
Jeff,
I am forwarding an analysis put together by sandeep kohlI and reviewed by
Vince and me. The results in the attached word document show that dabhol
Energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 mw of distributed
Generation which has been identified in maharastra. This 600 mw does not
Include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy
Costs. The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

Stinson

Vince/stinson,
Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as
Well as the revised statement that can be made to press.
The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of
The genset issue. They do not take into account the capital costs of the
Gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating
In homes, and commercial establishments.
Hope ths helps.
Regards,
Sandeep.
