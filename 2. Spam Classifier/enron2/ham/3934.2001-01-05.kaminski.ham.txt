Subject: vince/stinson,
Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as
Well as the revised statement that can be made to press.
The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of
The genset issue. They do not take into account the capital costs of the
Gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating
In homes, and commercial establishments.
Hope ths helps.
Regards,
Sandeep.
