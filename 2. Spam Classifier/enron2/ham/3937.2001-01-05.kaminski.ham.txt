George,
We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people
In the first round.
We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a
Bigger group. We would like to learn form experience how to run
It.
By the way, we had an option training for ees (roughly 150 people,
Over a few weeks). I can give you the materials and
We can repeat it if you think it' s useful.

Vince - I had heard about this derivatives class from clayton
And I am inquiring about the possibility of someone outside
Of the research group being able to attend. If so, I would
Like the opportunity. Let me know if it is possible.
Thanks,
George
