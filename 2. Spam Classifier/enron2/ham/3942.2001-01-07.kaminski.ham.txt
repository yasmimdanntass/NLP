Vince,
I would like to meet with you or someone in your group to discuss some of the
Investment ideas and structures we are exploring. How is your group
Structured these days? Who would be best for me to meet? Might you be
Available for lunch next week? I will have my assistant contact you.
Thank,
Kevin garland
