Subject: west power model
Lance and I spoke with tim heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for
The west desk. The differences in the markets between east and west are, in
Tim' s opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated
As the one we are pursuing for ercot. In particular, the termal limits for
Which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the west. Loop
Flows are also not considered a major issue at present.
In summary, it seems that the west is an unlikely customer of any extension
To an ercot/east transmission model for the time being. They have also done
Little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.
