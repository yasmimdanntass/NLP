Fyi. I shall not be surprised if grant knock on our door again in a few weeks.
I told him he could not count on the same generous treatment
He got the first time.

Dear vince:
?
After a very great deal of thought, I have decided to stick it out with el
Paso.
?
Please be assured that this exercise was not a" fishing expedition" to
Extract concessions from el paso.? Rather, it is simply that, although i
Continue to harbor doubts about some of el paso' s methods and about the
People running the business, I have concluded that two months is not enough
Time to fully judge the company.? I feel that I have not yet given el paso
(or myself for that matter) a fair chance.? After all, if I disagree with
The way the business is run, I should regard that as an opportunity to
Effect changes and not an excuse to run away.
?
Please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to all those who worked so
Hard over the holidays to produce the offer: david oxley, sheila walton, and
Especially norma villarreal.
?
And thanks also to you vince for your patience, humor, and good advice.? As
I' ve said before, I consider it an honor to be able to call you a colleague
And friend.
?
With best regards,
Grant.
