Andrea,
We finished the the costless collar valuation. See the spreadsheets for
Details.
We checked the bloomberg for volatility assumption. The 100 days volatility is
Around 50%. Since the option is for 3 years, the volatility should be
Somewhat smaller.
So we put an array of calculations, with the volatility ranges from 20% to
60%.
If you have any questions, please call me or bob lee.
