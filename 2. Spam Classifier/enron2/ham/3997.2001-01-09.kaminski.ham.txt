Vince,
?
I can offer you 12. 5% off of your order for 50 books (we originally spoke to
Habiba about setting up a 50% discount? But enron would have to order a
Minimum of 200 books.?? Since the? Change over, nothing has been set up on
This).?
?
Let me know if I should go ahead with the invoice.
?
Thanks,
Julie
