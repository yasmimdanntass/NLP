Vince,
Sounds good! It will take two or three days for me to strip out, reformat,
And assemble the kaminskI columns (since we didn' t do this last year, i' m
Guessing you mean all columns since the beginning), so I envision us being
Ready with the completed set the first part of next week. I assume that you
Would like me to omit those people who have moved on?
Also, on page three of the first volume, you had written an introduction. I
Have updated the content for volume two, but would you perhaps like to do a
New one?
