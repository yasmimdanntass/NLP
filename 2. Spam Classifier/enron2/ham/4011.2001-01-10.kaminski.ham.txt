Tanya,
We have checked the risktrac system and
(1) the spreadoption, and other, mappings in risktrac are correct. Ie,
Els 1 b has both power (ppp) and gas (nbp) and the deltas/gammas tie out. The
Lolp and smp mappings all tie out.
(2) however, the uk power in risktrac has 25 twh more of power. This has
Something to do with the enpower - risktrac communication.
(3) uk - gas positions tie out in aggregate (off by a single bcf)
For var discrepancies, other than positions, the following will contrbute
(1) in risktrac power is mapped to r 4 (cinergy) while in the spreadsheet it
Is us - ng.
(2) gas - power and efa - efa correlations are different.
Matthew is coordinating with oliver and london it to resolve the position
Issues.

Naveen and matthew,
I started looking systematically through uk positions and corresponding var
Numbers in the risckrac.
I found a few inconsistencies so far.
1. The portfolio elsb 1 - nbp has a book elsb 1 under it. The sum of delta
Positions for this book is
239, 021, 655, the sum of gamma positions is - 211, 031, 450. Var for the
Portfolio elsb 1 - nbp is zero.
The same refers to a few other portfolios, for example elsb 2 - nbp, elsb 3 - nbp,
E 2 xxl - nbp.
2. The portfolio elsbp 1 - ppp also has the book elsb 1 under it. This book
Contains the positions on pppwdl
Through pppwd 6 and pppwel through pppwe 4.
The same refers to the other books, for example elsb 2.
This looks messy. Can someone in rac go over all the portfolios, all the
Corresponding books and curves
In risktrac and make sure they are set up properly?
Thank you,
Tanya.
