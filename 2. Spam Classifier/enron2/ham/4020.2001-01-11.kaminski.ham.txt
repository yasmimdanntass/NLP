Ryan and I have looked at the research model and made some adjustments.
The treasury rate at 12/28/00 was 5. 127% (research uses 4. 6% which probably
Takes into account the recent fed 50 bp cut)
The maturity is 6/30/03 or 2. 5 years (research uses 3 years)
Using these assumptions and a 47. 2% volatility in the bloomberg collar
Function results in a ceiling of 92 103/256 and a floor of 34 7/8. After
Adjusting the research model for the changes above, ryan and I got a similar
Range from the research model so we are comfortable with these numbers.
Let me know if there are any questions.

Attached is the updated valuation from bob lee in research using the actual
3 - year historical vol. Of 47. 2 which results in a call strike of 97. 978.
Also, he has confirmed that the presence of the swap has no impact on the
Value of the collar. Let me know if you have questions. Thanks,
Ron

Here' s the calculation using the historical volatility. The strike drops
Slightly. The volatility in the calculation is the expected future
Vol; atility - looking at traded options for hc and an expected fall off in
Vol for long dated options, one could justify a vol estimate in the range 40
- 50% for the collar.
The presence of the swap makes no difference on the collar valuation.
