Subject: as promised molly
Sorry about the mix - up on the email molly.
I hope you get this one.
As most good corporations like enron have predefined contractual arrangements
To do executive search business I will be happy to abide by your terms and
Rules.
And to be quite honest - enron is about the" best it gets" so, I prefer to not
Draft a contract this time or for this relationship - I will wait for yours to
Be signed by me. The only stipulation I request of you is that upon
Contractual performance, enron accounts payable please wire my funds to my
Account as I have a multI - currency account denominated in usd/canadian or
British pounds (which ever fits you as I may need to pay my counterparts in
The uk)... Other than that I have no perplexities.
I will send you my wire instructions later, either my bank in california or
In bermuda.
As I live in california and do contingency search, I must go off of my
Client' s" good word" on occasion and luckily haven' t had any problems so
Far... I always honor california verbal contract law - if I do not draft.
I think you fee payment of 20% is generous and the industry standard of 30
Day guarantee on replacement is fair. Obviously there is no deposit on any
Contingency and if there is a definite urgent need for a position to be
Filled only then will I ask your help for a minor deposit to aid in my
Overhead to shift all my resources to search on behalf on enron.
As enron has the in - house power to probably not need this service then
Obviously a deposit will not be required.
If you wish me to send my standard agreement then I will, but you have made
Yourself perfectly clear by phone what you are willing to do. I therefore
Will be happy to receive you contract and follow your instructions.
I thank you and vince for allowing me to work with enron and pledge to you my
Best work and candidates utilizing my network of contacts.
I am very excited about our new relationship and hope to give you my very
Best service.
Thank you very much for this opportunity molly, please send my your contract
So, that I may sign it and send it right back to you immediately. I am
Looking forward to working with vince and you.
Thank you again,
Jeff wesley
Ps - I can utilize to resources of management recruiters international usa and
Robert walters of the uk to aid in my service to you.
Best regards,
Jeff wesley
Always held in strict confidence.
