Subject: latest draft
Vince,
I have added a lot of material to" fill in the wholes" and would like your
Reaction to the current draft. I am still not very happy with the risk
Management segment (primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge) so
Please read it carefully and get me your comments.
I plan to let don chew (the editor) take a look at it to give us his
Guidance toward a successful draft.
Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year.
Your friend
John
P. S. I really enjoyed your papers. Those should definitely be part of a
Class on risk management.
