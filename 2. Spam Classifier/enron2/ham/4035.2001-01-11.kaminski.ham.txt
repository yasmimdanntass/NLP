Subject: sr. Director position
Vince: as you requested, I have obtained some information from norma
Relating to the salary parameters of the sr. Director position. The minimum
Salary is $83, 800, and the maximum is $168, 000 (huge range, isn' t it?).
However, norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention: the
Lowest salary of a vp in your group is currently $140, 000, and the average
Director' s salary in your group is $120, 000. Those numbers narrow the
Range considerably. Of course, there is no equity issue since there is no
Other senior director in your group.
Hope this information helps,
Molly
