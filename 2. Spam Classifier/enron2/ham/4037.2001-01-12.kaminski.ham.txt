Subject: henwood team
Folks,
I have been a bit quiet here since reaching india, primarily because of the
Delay in the arrival of the henwood team from australia.
They are finally arriving on sunday, and krishna is joining me in mumbaI on
Sunday evening itself.
I would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data
And the type fo questions that you all would like to ask.
Stinson - could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all
To hae a confernce call, but not earlier than monday evening, india time
(monday morning houston time). Please jot me a note on what would be a good
Time for the call.
I will work out an agenda for the call. Primarily, it will be discussion of
The data and on what runs we should do to begin with.
Another key part of this will be the rate case that mseb is filing, because
This will determine what wil be mseb' s paymet capability in 2001/02. This is
Critical for us. We have our in - house expert who has been working on this
For some time now, and he will also present some of the material on that call.
Regards,
Sandeep.
Ps:: I am forwarding the basic data that henwood has sent to the whole team
So that you have an opportunity to look at it, if you havent already got it.
