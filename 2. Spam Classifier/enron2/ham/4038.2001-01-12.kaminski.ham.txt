Subject: india database
Jim/wade,
As you are aware, I have been working with vince' s group on the henwood model
Data. The target was to have data on all india plants collected by jan. 15 th.
We all know that getting power out o maharashtra holds the key to being able
To solve the dabhol challenge. With all of your help, this model can become
The tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.
We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got
Data of some 1500 plants across the country. The spreadsheet for the same is
Attached. This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls
About the various plants. Please note that we are located in the western
Region, or wr in the spreadsheet. We will be further scrubbing the data and
Getting more recent and accurate information, especially on maharashtra over
The next 2 - 3 days.
The henwood team will be in india on sunday, and will compare notes with the
Team here. I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will
Do.
Wade - it would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including
Neil, yourself and mohan. I will talk to you about a convenient time for you
In this regard.
Neil & mohan - over the next week (monday and tuesday) I will need some time
From vivek, anshuman, ravi, and a few others, to interact with the henwood
Team. I will be abliged if you can make that possible.
The first phase of model runs (which will be done by jan. End) will just give
Us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order
To ask the right questions. The idea is that as we go along, this model will
Be used to answer all types of management questions concerning dabhol, and
Power evacuation out of maharashtra.
This will be critical for the team going forward.
Regards,
Sandeep.
