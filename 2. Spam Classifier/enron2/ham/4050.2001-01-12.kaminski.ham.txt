Subject: thank you
Darren, thank you for cordinating everything.
I understand it takes time, this is
Only the first week of the year in japan, and I do not like to
Push you much. Normally, I have long meetings every thursday.
For other dates, I make best effort to fit the schedule for
Your convenience, including early morning or late evening.
I am looking forward to seeing you sometime soon.
Sincerely,
YumI imokawa
