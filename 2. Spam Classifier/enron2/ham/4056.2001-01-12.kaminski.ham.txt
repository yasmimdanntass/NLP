Subject: first derivatives class
Bob,
I have asked martin, zimin, and paulo to prepare short presentations on the
Power, gas, and crude markets, respectively. This will take probably 45
Minutes of class time. In addition I will prepare some lecture
Material. If we don' t have enough class time to cover all assigned
Problems, we can just roll them to the next class.
Thanks,
Stinson
