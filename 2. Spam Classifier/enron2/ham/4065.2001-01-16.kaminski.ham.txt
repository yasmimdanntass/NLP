Subject: I will miss the tuesday staff meeting
Vince,
I will not be able to attend the meeting. Here are some updates:
1) I left a message to george posey, I will follow up tomorrow (tuesday),
2) I will follow up on the credit reserve issue asap, I will find out what the
Present state of the models are and come up with modification requirements
To accomodate asset related projects.
3) this week I will need to spend much of my time in meeting with the
Breakthrough
Folks. They are at a stage where
Our contribution is being defined and specifies (curves, components, etc.).
If you
Would like to contact me urgently, please leave a phone message instead of
E - mail - -
I will be checking my phone messages more frequently.
4) we have a var meeting with rac on eam issues wednesday at lpm.
5) other issues are covered in my project list.
Regards,
Osman
