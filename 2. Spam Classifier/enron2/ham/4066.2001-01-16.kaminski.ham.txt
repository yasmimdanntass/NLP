Vince,
Please find attached a small note I had prepared at wade' s request. The note
Is to be used for a private meeting of the ex - chairman of mseb with the
Governor of maharashtra. In the indian system, the governor represents the
Federal government in the state. Hence any information he gathers is for the
Central govt.
This informal note is to be passed to him. The focus as you will see is to
See if we can engage the central govt. Through this route.
Krishna is here and sends his regards.
Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade,
Please find the note attached for mr. Basak. The tariff data is all from the
Information sheet put out by mohan, so you should have no conflicts.
I have tried to give it the appropriate spin.
Let me know if there is something you would like to do differently on this.
Regards,
Sandeep.
