Hi, mr. Kaminski:
How are you?
I am back to school for the new semester now. I am in contact with molly
Magee for my travlling schedule to enron.
I got from garp that you chaired a seeesion on energy risk at the new york
Conference last week. If it is not too much trouble, could you please send a
Copy of your presentation to me? I appreciate it.
See you soon!
Frank
