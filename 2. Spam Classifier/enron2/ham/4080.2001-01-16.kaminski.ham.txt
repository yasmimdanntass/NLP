Shirley,
Will you check with vince on the support schedule for me? I need to get the
Support to the bus in order to get them to agree on the 2001 billing. If you
Have any questions, call me. Thanx.

We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names
And projects that research is working on for various bus. Can you tell me
How you are doing on that? Sarah brown, my manager, had a meeting with corp
And they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1. 9 m).
Their argument is that they are going to bill ena back anyway; therefore,
They have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001,
Which is approximately $760 k. If you have any questions, please call. Thanx.
