Vince, this will be perfect for us. We will work with shirley while keeping
You and krishna informed of the timing and location of the move. I will also
Speak with youyI tomorrow about our plans. Many thanks, kim.

HI kim,
I don' t see any problem. For the time being, he can keep his desk on the 19 th
Floor as
Well (and the same phone number). It will be helpful when he has to work
Closely with krishna
Under time constraint.
At some point, as we hire more people and run out of space, we can move him
Completely to
Your floor.
Please, ask your assistant to call shirley and arrange the move.
Vince

HI vince!
I hope you and a nice christmas and new year! It' s nice to be back and in
The full swing of the new year.
I have a question for you. I spoke with krishna prior to him leaving for
India about the possibility of moving youyI up to our floor so that we can
Work closer with him. Krishna thought that this would be a good idea. It
Would be great to have youyI with us soon so that he will be intimately
Involved with the whole approach of our prototype model. Although krishna
Will be back at the end of the month, would you mind if I speak with youyi
And begin the paperwork for moving him onto our floor? I' m not sure if
Krishna has mentioned this to youyI yet. I did not want to surprise anyone
And wanted to run this by you or krishna for final approval.
Many thanks, kim.
