You only thought the festive days were over
What a better way to start off the new year than to celebrate our good friend
Paula corey , s birthday
We will have a little soiree at my house on saturday january 27 th, dinner
Will be served at 7: 00, please feel free to come out as early as you wish;
However if you arrive too early you may be requested to perform some ranch
Chores.
Please feel free to bring a spouse or friend if you choose. If you could
Rsvp by jan 23 rd that would be great.
Directions to my house are as follows:
Take I 45 north past the woodlands towards conroe
Take exit 83 crighton road exit
Stay on feeder road through stop sign until you get to traffic light
(crighton road)
Turn right onto crighton road cross railroad tracks
Go to 3 rd street, about 1
Miles, and turn right, which is the only way you
Can turn. This is kidd road; however most of the time the street sign is
Knocked down.
Stay on kidd road until it dead ends at stidham and turn left.
