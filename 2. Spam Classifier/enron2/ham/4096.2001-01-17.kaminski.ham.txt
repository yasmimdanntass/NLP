Subject: re: enron cover letter & resume for dave gershenson
Vincent,
I have forwarded the resume to our analysts/associate pool with
A recommendation to accept david as a summer intern.
I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
Work for a different unit of enron. It' s up to him and I shall not be offended
If he would like to go into trading or deal origination.
Vince
