Hi,
Thanks for the fed ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent
Information about enron.
I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of
Other forms. You should receive these documents via fed ex on tomorrow
Morning.
Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in california, I won' t
Be able to start until march lst. I hope that is okay.
Thanks so much.
Regards,
Iris
