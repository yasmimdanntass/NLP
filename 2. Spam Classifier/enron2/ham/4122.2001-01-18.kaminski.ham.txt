Dave delaney called an hour ago. He needed a statistic from eol that the eol
Folks couldn' t give him (it seems they had a database problem in 1999), and
The grapevine had it we had the data. Tom barkley was able to give him the
Data he needed for his presentation, within a matter of 10 minutes or so.
