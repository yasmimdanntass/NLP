Subject: howard & lawrence for vince
Hey vince!
Here is a picture of howard lin and picture of lawrence (the guy I spoke to
You about over the telephone) and his new resume.
I will call alec tonight in london to let him know that you sent the" other
Howard" (howard haughton over to enron uk).
Lawrence has banking and online experience with hsbc - he is being examined
Only by one other company that I know of (williams) that is my competitor. He
Also went to the chief investment officer of the san diego pension fund (a
Friend of mine). I don' t think he is a" best fit" - but, if you like him - i' ll
Get him for you!
I have a great relationship with him.
Ok!
Thanks,
Jeff wesley
Ps - I kinda like lawrence' s" look", vince.
Always held in strict confidence.
