I suspect that enron india llc would be the entity to use. However, is
Anyone from tax involved in this? If not, we need to get someone in the
Loop.

Stinson,
Please find attached a revised version of the draft consulting agreement with
Henwood. Fyi, I am attaching both a clean version and one marked toshow
Changes from the last draft I sent you. Please let me know if you have any
Questions or comments on the agreement or the most recent changes.
What is the status of henwood? Do you still want to engage them and what is
The timeframe for their work (the dates in the draft may need to be
Corrected).
Bruce and lauren: please advise on which enron entity should be the party to
This consulting agreement.
Thanks, bonnie
