Have you had a chance to interview? If not, we can make arrangements to have
Candidate interviewed when we go to chicago for summer associate interviews.
Let me know and I will get the chicago recruiter to add to schedule.

Hi, vince,
This is li, writing from u. Of chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
With the experience I had with enron.
A schoolmate of mine, a chicago ph. D. Candidate in finance,
Is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
Or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don' t mind that
I sell enron at school so hard.
Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.
Li
P. S.: cover letter below and resume attached.

Dear dr. Vince kaminski,
I am a ph. D. Student in finance at the university of chicago gsb who =
Hopes to find a summer internship at enron of 2001 (between june and =
September). I heard your group from my friend li, who worked at enron =
For 3 year. She spoke highly of you. If it' s okay, I am primarily =
Interested in risk management.
At the university of chicago, I will have completed all the ph. D. =
Courses in the area of finance by the end of the first year. As normally =
It takes two years to finish the required finance courses, I decided to =
Take all the finance courses in the first year. In the fall quarter, I =
Already took empirical asset pricing and theoretical asset pricing and =
Did very well. In the winter quarter, I will be taking corporate =
Finance, continuous time finance and behavioral finance. I am exposed to =
All fields of finance. Prior to coming to chicago, I received a master' s =
Degree in economics at washington university in saint louis where I =
Acquired skills in economic analysis. I also have a strong background in =
Statistics and mathematics. This makes me believe that I have acquired =
The ability to do financial research.
Prior to coming to the united state, I was an outstanding graduate from =
Beijing university, china. I was the founder and president of beijng =
Univeristy society of oceanology. I also organized a research jouney in =
The round - the - bo - sea economic region. These experience helped to hone my =
Communication and interpersonal skills.
As illustrated above, my skills and expertise are ideally suited for =
Financial research. My resume is enclosed. In the event that you think =
An interview is in need, my time is very flexible. Your assistance is =
Appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
Jason chen (huafeng)
