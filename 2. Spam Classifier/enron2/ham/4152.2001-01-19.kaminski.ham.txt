I am going to have the team look at the problem. Hopefully it will be an
Easy fix. Otherwise, we can work off the worksheets that you complete over
The weekend. You have my cell number if you have any questions.

Subject: merit increases
Norma,
It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error mixing equity and
Merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the
Mistake by
Moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
After I save them the system reverts to original designations.
As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity
Raises.
The column totals are misleading.
I am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home monday (281 367 5377).
