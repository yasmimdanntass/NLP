Subject: merit increases
Norma,
It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error mixing equity and
Merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the
Mistake by
Moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
After I save them the system reverts to original designations.
As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity
Raises.
The column totals are misleading.
I am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home monday (281 367 5377).
Vince
