Molly: just to be sure that everyone understands, anshuman cannot work in
The us on a bl visa - he can only come here for business meetings and
Training.
We will have to get him the ll visa in order for him to work in the us.

Molly,
I shall ask sandeep to do it when he comes back from india next week.
I have just learned that anshuman has bl visa and he can start on a project
As a person
Delegated by dhabol power company to houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the ll visa.

I agree that it makes sense to put the ll in place. There are several things
We will need from you in order to start the visa process. The first is a
Fairly detailed job description for anshuman. Secondly, we also need to know
Whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a
Project. If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job
Description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.
As for sandeep, I have been told that he is a u. S. Resident so there should
Be no problems with him. Margaret daffin will be contacting him to be
Absolutely sure.
Thanks,
Molly

Molly,
Let' s get ll for anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a
While
Once he comes. It is quite obvious jeff shankman will have to keep him
Longer,
Given the priority of the project.
I assume there are no problems with sandeep.
Thanks.

Thank you for the update, vince. I have been working with margaret daffin
With regard to anshuman' s visa status. We will have to get an ll visa in
Place before he can come to the united states, even in a temporary
Capacity. Do you want to move forward with that effort at this time, or
Is the possibility of him coming to the u. S. So remote that it wouldn' t be
Worth the time and money right now?

Molly,
This is an update on anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
That his transfer is not an issue for the time being.
We can put it on a back - burner till he gets here.
Vince
P. S. The relevant section.
I also spoke about anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such
A long time. However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to
Houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget. I will try to finalize that
Before I leave. I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,
Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with wade cline (coo, enron
India), neil mcgregor (president, dpc), and mohan gurunath (cfo, dpc) today.
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
Group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move. I
Explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the
Henwood study.
Dpc would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned. There
Maybe some tax issues etc. That need to be cleared, and other related issues
That I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to
Houston.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have. Things here
Have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks. Morale is quite down
Due to many lay - offs.
I am really looking forward to returning to houston, and the family!!
Regards,
Sandeep.
