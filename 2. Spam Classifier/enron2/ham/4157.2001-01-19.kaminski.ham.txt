Subject: iris mack
Vince: I received a phone call yesterday afternoon from iris, with a special
Request of you. She says that she will have to break her lease when she
Comes to houston. She will have a three - month period during which she will
Have to pay rent (march, april and may), at the monthly rate of $1, 175. She
Is asking if we would be willing to pay $3, 525 to compensate her for this
Extra expense.
I have a phone call in to the relocation department to find out how much cash
Iris will be receiving from us under the normal relocation benefits, and will
Let you know as soon as I hear from them. I would imagine that it is a
Fairly substantial amount, since she is moving from california and since our
Relocation benefit is very generous.
