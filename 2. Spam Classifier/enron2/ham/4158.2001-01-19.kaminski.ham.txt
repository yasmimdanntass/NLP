Subject: transition to research group - an update
Vince,
Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with wade cline (coo, enron
India), neil mcgregor (president, dpc), and mohan gurunath (cfo, dpc) today.
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
Group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move. I
Explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the
Henwood study.
Dpc would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned. There
Maybe some tax issues etc. That need to be cleared, and other related issues
That I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to
Houston.
I also spoke about anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such
A long time. However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to
Houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget. I will try to finalize that
Before I leave. I will call you in the evening to just chat.
I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have. Things here
Have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks. Morale is quite down
Due to many lay - offs.
I am really looking forward to returning to houston, and the family!!
Regards,
Sandeep.
