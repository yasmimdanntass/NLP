Subject: tuesday morning meeting first thing???
Vince:
I am sorry I couldnt connect with you last week. How would your tuesday
Morning first thing, say 800 or 830 am be to get together to discuss the
Demo proposal and other issues? I can come by your office very conveniently
Then. Give me an email shout if you could squeeze it in on monday. I look
Forward to speaking with you.
