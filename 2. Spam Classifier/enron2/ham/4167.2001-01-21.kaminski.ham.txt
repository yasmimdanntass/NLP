Subject: enron tiger team
Dear jeff,
Our tiger team very much enjoyed your presentation about enron global markets
On friday. Given that we have latitude in our project scope, our team would
Like to assist enron in evaluating a new market opportunity. You mentioned
Several markets that enron is considering in 2001, including transportation,
Cement, coffee, cocoa, sugar, etc. We believe that a project of this sort
Will give us the opportunity to really learn how enron creates value, what
Its business model and core competencies are, and how they can be translated
To a new market. Furthermore, we can get an in - depth understanding of an
Industry. We believe our project will complement any analysis that your
Business group is currently undertaking. Please propose the top three new
Markets that you would like us to evaluate for enron.
Upon receipt of your proposal, perhaps we could set up a conference call to
Discuss your thoughts and to make a final selection.
Your expeditious response is appreciated.
Regards,
Josh leventhal
