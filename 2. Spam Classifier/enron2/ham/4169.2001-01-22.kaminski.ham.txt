Badri,
In the event dpc signs the contract, we would need to make it indian tax
Efficient. Please suggest the structure/clauses/information required by which
We need not pay withholding taxes. If you need more info on the scope of work
Contemplated you can talk to wade/neil/sandeep.
Regards
Mohan

Wade/mohan,
Please find below the last draft copy of the henwood consulting agreement.
We need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ene policies.
As you will see, the draft agreement is made out with enron in mind, even
Though we have left the company name blank in the agreement.
Mohan - last when we spoke (friday), you were going to explore the tax
Aspects of having dpc be the signing company. Please tell us if that works.
Separately, you and wade may need to consider how dpc lenders may look upon
Some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of
It in lender domain.
Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be eipl, ene
Houston, or dpc. We could also have a version where ene houston is signing
The contract on behalf of dpc.
Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly. If you
Would like someone in eipl/dpc to be signing the contract, please let me
Know, who the signing authority is. I suspect, that even I could sign on
Behalf of dpc or ene?? If so, I will be in houston on wednesday, and sign
At the time. If not, you can assign someone to sign.
Regards,
Sandeep.

I suspect that enron india llc would be the entity to use. However, is
Anyone from tax involved in this? If not, we need to get someone in the
Loop.

Stinson,
Please find attached a revised version of the draft consulting agreement with
Henwood. Fyi, I am attaching both a clean version and one marked toshow
Changes from the last draft I sent you. Please let me know if you have any
Questions or comments on the agreement or the most recent changes.
What is the status of henwood? Do you still want to engage them and what is
The timeframe for their work (the dates in the draft may need to be
Corrected).
Bruce and lauren: please advise on which enron entity should be the party to
This consulting agreement.
Thanks, bonnie
