Subject: good morning
Vince,
Two items. Unless you have an objection, I plan to ship the paper on to
Don chew at the journal this morning. We can still work on the article but
He needs something to begin the editing process.
Second, in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a
Roundtable discussion involving sheridan titman, john mccormack (stern
Stewart), ron erd (southern energy), jeff sandifer (president of sandifer
Capital - - $700 million undermanagement), and gene humphries. Attached you
Will find a section that will not be in the final document, but that i
Thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the
Course of writing this paper.
Have a great day.
John
