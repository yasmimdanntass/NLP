Subject: anshuman shrivastava - visa application
Ranendra: I have been asked to begin the visa process for the above
Individual, located in india.
I believe mr. Shrivastava has been working as assistant manager with enron
Since may 10, 1998. If this is correct, we will be able to bring him into
The us on an ll intracompany visa under the blanklet l for enron.
Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him
The required visa questionnaire to begin the process.
Many thanks
