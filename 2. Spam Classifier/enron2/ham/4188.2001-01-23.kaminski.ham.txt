Steve,
Please, let me know when you come back.
I have detected a tendency to implement different
Approaches to valuation in the past.
To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal
Rules for sign - off on the valuation techniques
Which, in turn, reflects, the turf wars and the desire by the
Originators to control the outcomes.

Vince,
I' d like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.
I' m hearing confusing messages about the way that the uk it team and the uk
Traders get their valuation code aparently signed off by research, while
Here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.
We have now a situation where the uk team are using a home grown valuation
Piece called dove, where results differ from those of the equivalent usa
Portcalc.
I need to break through the pride barriers and the" not built here"
Syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don' t beleive I can do that
Without you guidance.
I' m scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these
Systems.
