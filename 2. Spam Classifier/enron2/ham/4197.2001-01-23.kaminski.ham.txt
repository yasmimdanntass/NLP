Everyone should read the attached risk article about calculating def probs
From cds quotes.
Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both
Cds valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the
Reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating cds quotes,
They propose minimising an error measure based on' smoothness' of def prob
Curve and difference between model and market prices.
What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in
Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus
One excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no
Reason why we shouldn' t have similar work published ourselves.
