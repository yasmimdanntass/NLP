Vince, thanks for your very prompt email response. I passed your message
Along to dave.
Thanks also for a great dinner and day of meetings last week. I really
Enjoyed the chance to learn more about enron, and was very impressed with
Everyone I met.
Look forward to working with you these next few months!!
Cheers,
Vincent

Vincent,
I have forwarded the resume to our analysts/associate pool with
A recommendation to accept david as a summer intern.
I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
Work for a different unit of enron. It' s up to him and I shall not be
Offended
If he would like to go into trading or deal origination.
Vince
