Subject: merit and equity increases
Norma,
I am sending you an excel spreadsheet with proposed
Merit and equity increases.
I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
The equity increases address two issues: retention and
And an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).
Please, let me know if there are any questions.
I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address
So I can work on it tonight, if necessary.
Vince
