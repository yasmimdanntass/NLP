Vince: your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
The lays is welcomed. I hope that this would mean that you would remain
Involved at some level. The design of the model and its potential
Economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be. Enron could
Be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
Commercialization could be successfully accomplished. Please
Confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
Interest generated. I am ready to meet there at your building or
Elsewhere that is appropriate. Best regards, al arfsten 713 965 2158
