Subject: consulting arrangement
Vince:
I just wanted to check with you regarding the consulting arrangement we
Discussed a couple of weeks ago.
Perhaps, we should start with just a 1 or 2 day contract where I give some
Thoughts to the kind of issues that we discussed and come to houston to
Present my preliminary thoughts and possible avenues for additional work.
Regards,
Sheridan
