Subject: anshuman
Neil,
I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
Trip to houston and there was a lot of confusion
Regarding the terms (given that I was talking to sandeep
Every few days).
Currently, we expect anshuman to come to houston for one month
To work on the dpc project (at jeff shankman' s request). The lawyers advised
Me that we need an ll visa for him, irrespective of the duration
Of his stay.
Sorry for the confusion.
