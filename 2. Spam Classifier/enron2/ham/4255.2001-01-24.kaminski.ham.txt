Molly,
Thanks for the update. Two points.
Please, let neil mcgregor know that many possible proposals were floated
With regard to anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need ll visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.
Also, if I have the choice between upsetting neil or jeffs (shankman and
Skilling),
I shall choose neil.

Vince: apparently neil mcgregor became upset when he received margaret
Daffin' s email. He is saying, however, that anshuman will only be in
Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke
Earlier. It really doesn' t make any difference since he will need to get an
Ll visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his
Email.
Molly
