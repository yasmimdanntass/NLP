Thanks for the clarification vince I appreciate it. We have a significant
Resource problem here in india, given we have a renegotiation about fall in
Our laps. Anshuman is one of our key analysts and we are very proud of his
Abilities and future potential for enron. Once we have dabhol off the" life
Support system" we could look at a longer assignment. As far as the present
One month assignment is concerned, I would rather go for an early start say
5 th feb till 5 th march. Is this convenient to you and jeff.

Neil,
I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
Trip to houston and there was a lot of confusion
Regarding the terms (given that I was talking to sandeep
Every few days).
Currently, we expect anshuman to come to houston for one month
To work on the dpc project (at jeff shankman' s request). The lawyers advised
Me that we need an ll visa for him, irrespective of the duration
Of his stay.
Sorry for the confusion.
