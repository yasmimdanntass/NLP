Notice of end of probation
I am writing to inform you that the six month probationary period for sharad
AgnihotrI is due to end on the 21/02/2001.
Please can you let me know as soon as possible if you want to:
* pass the probationary period
* fail the probationary period * *
* * in this case you will need to discuss with human resources
If the probationary period is passed I will send out a letter to this effect
For you to sign and pass to your employee.
Thank you
Zoe
