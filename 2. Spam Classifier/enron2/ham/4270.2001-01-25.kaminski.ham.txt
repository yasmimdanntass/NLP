Tanya,
I have checked the factors for us power and all except the
Following are acceptable:
Rl 1, rlc, rlf, rlj, rlk, rll, rlm, rln, rlz, r 4 a, r 4 b.
For global liquids, the requisite curves have been submitted to the
Liquids team. I will review their results and confirm.

Naveen,
Attached spreadsheet contains the factors for us power curves calculated
Based on 9/28/00 - 11/28/00 data in stage with the latest version of vatrfacs.
By specifying integer number from 1 to 32 in cell jl you can see the factors
For different regions.
I suggest to consider the following sets of factors as acceptable:
Rla, rle, r 2, r 2 a, r 2 b, r 3, r 3 a, r 3 b, r 4, r 4 c, r 5, r 5 a, r 6, r 7, r 7 a, r 8, r 9.
Please review and confirm.
Tanya.
