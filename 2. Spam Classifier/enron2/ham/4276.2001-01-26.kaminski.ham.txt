Subject: re: calpx prices
Jason,
I think what you may be asking for are caliso power prices. The calpx is a
Scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to
The caliso. The iso combines the curves from participating scs (of which i
Believe enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices.
The caliso prices are available from rdI powerdat, the enron lim database, and
A number of other sources. Recent historical prices are available from the
Caliso web site.
I am copying your mail to tim hiezenrader, who runs the westdesk fundamentals
Group. I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more
Real - time caliso data that enron collects.
Tim, can you help jason out? He is a manager in the ena research group.
Thanks,
Michael
