Al,
Thanks for the update. I hope that you and mark
Will come up with a good plan of attack.

In this project.

I did understand that you were still at the concept stage. It is a very
Interesting proposal and I would like to think about it.
Thanks,

Mark lay: I shared confidentially with vince kaminskI my developing
Concept of a highly inefficient not - for - profit enterprise with
Dramatically increasing costs. I believe that a for - profit economic
Model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
Ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
Impact of health care costs. Vince seems to also believe in the
Concepts potential. The ceo of one of the biggest u. S. Blood banks has
Already asked to become involved. I would like involve more people
With vision, means and desire to help make this a reality. I would look
Forward to meeting with you to talk further. Al arfsten 713 965 2158
