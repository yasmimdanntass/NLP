Mike...
In response to phil clifford' s request - I have constructed webpage that
Provides wind, wave, and storm information for the production and
Tranportation areas of the north atlantic. I' ve linked the site from the
Research weather homepage to the european weather support page. Here is the
Link:
From here - follow the:" north atlantic production/transport" link. Let' s
See what customer feedback we get - and I will continue to investigate
Further avenues
Of support.
