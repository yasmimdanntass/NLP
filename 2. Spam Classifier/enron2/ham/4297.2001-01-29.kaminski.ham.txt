Siva, I will have to check and see if we can accomodate a 5 day 8 to 5
Class. Also, president' s day is a holiday for us, so we may have to look
At a later date.

Stinson,
I have attached a file along with this email
That lists the software needed for our
Java class.
We would like to do the class from monday thru
Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. That way we can complete
The class within a week. We are unable to offer
Classes in the evenings or for few hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
Other clients and because of that we won' t
Be available.
Currently, we can do the class from feb. 19 th
Through feb. 23 (that is if you are working on
Feb 19 th, president' s day).
I will call you sometime this afternoon to talk
Further. Please feel free to reach me if you have
Any further questions in the mean time.
Regards,
- siva
