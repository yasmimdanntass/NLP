Subject: approval is overdue: access request for paul. D. Thomas@ enron. Com
Mike,
Following request has been made for a number of people.
The access requested is: o:\research\power meteorology\weather temperatures -
Read/write
Data approval grant
This is what I wrote, denying the request:
The reason for the rejection has been communicated several times.
The person who requested the access does not want it any more. Granting both
Read/write access could threaten the integrity of the data.
Any comments?
Vince
