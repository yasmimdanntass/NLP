Subject: p + spread options
Jeff,
We are reviewing the p + spread option book. One item of note is that the
Correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from
What was being used a year ago (see charts below). I also remember that
John mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book. In fact
He wanted to book options with a correlation of 1. 0, but our model would not
Allow it, so he was using 0. 999.
We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well. If
You want, vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day. Just
Let me know what time would be convenient.
