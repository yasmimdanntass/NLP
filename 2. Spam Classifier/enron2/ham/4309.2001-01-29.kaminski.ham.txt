Stinson,
Just a quick note to let you know that I am looking into it,
Trying to rearrange a couple of things. I' d like giuseppe and
Possibly eric to come with me, so I need to coordinate with
Them too. We' ve made some nice progress that i' d like to present
And also integrate eric in the system.
I am targeting a friday around the end of february or begining
Of march. I' ll let you know soon of a few possibilities as they
Stabilize here.
Best,
Nick
