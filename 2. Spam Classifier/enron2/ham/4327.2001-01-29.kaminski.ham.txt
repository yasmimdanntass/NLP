Jeff,
It seems that nymex will not make a decision any time soon
Or they rejected tom. I think the latter is the case.
Tom is looking for a trading or origination job with enron.
I think that we can use his expertise here.

I thought he was in the running for the president position, after pat died.
He phoned me today - - did he indicate to you in what he is interested?

Subject: tom costantino
Jeff, greg and john,
Our old friend tom costantino is interested in coming back
To enron. It seems that his move to nymex either will not happen
Or will not happen for some time.
You can contact him at home:
