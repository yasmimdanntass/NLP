I discussed this with vince kaminskI and he said that, while we would be
Glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
(they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. Would be too time
Consuming for us at this time.
You can go to www. Lacimagroup. Com and order the books directly. Tell
Them you are ordering the books for use at enron and they should give you
A 15% discount.
I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

Subject:" energy derivatives"
As we had discussed in our phone conversation friday, I would ask you to
Order six copies of the newly enron - published" energy derivatives" for
Paradigm strategy group. We do the various derivatives training courses for
Enron, and this book will be required reading for all our instructors.
Please advise as to the total cost of the books. If payment by check is ok,
Please let me know to whom the check should be made payable.
You can reach me by e - mail, or phone at 281 - 360 - 7822.
Thanks for your help.
