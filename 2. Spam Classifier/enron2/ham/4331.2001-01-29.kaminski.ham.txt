Here' s the story.
Research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for java
Training by an outside person, weeklong classes for true beginners and for
Those with decent programming experience in other languages (esp c + +). Vince
Had pre - agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it. But, the response
They got was so" overwhelming" they reconsidered, for financial reasons, and
Decided it would be better to just hire a professor to teach a class for a
Week here. The costs would be around $15, 000, and there should be room for
Around 15 people in the class. They have 6 - 8 people, and wonder if we might
Have some people who would want to do it (a no - brainer - java is a big - time
Resume pad these days) and would be willing to share the costs with them.
What is your opinion on this? Personally, I think it' s a relatively
Inexpensive investment in our people, although, selfishly, it does increase
Their' market value' so to speak. (of course, nothing keeps directors from
Going to the class as well:))
