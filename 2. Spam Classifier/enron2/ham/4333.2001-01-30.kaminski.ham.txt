Stinson,
?
Here are some options considering what you have
Said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from may 7 to 11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of training
Then we can try this.? We have done this before and it has
Worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20 - 23, tue - fri, 12: 00 to 5: 00
Week 2 (20 hours):? April 9 - 12, mon - thu, 12: 00 to 5: 00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for venkat
To teach before may 7 th date.?
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I look forward to
Hearing from you.?
?
Regards,
?

Stinson,
I have attached a file along with this email
That lists the software needed for our
Java class.
We would like to do the class from monday thru
Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.? That way we can complete
The class within a? Week.? We are unable to offer
Classes in the evenings or for few hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
Other clients and because of that? We won' t
Be available.
Currently, we can do the class from feb. 19 th
Through feb. 23 (that is if you are working on
Feb 19 th, president' s day).
I will call? You sometime this afternoon to talk
Further.? Please feel free to reach me if you have
Any further questions in the mean time.
Regards,
- siva
