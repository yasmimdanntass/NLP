Subject: interview schedule
Good morning:
I am attaching dr. Valverde' s interview schedule for thursday, february 1.
When he arrives at the enron bldg. (1400 smith street), go to the
Security desk and ask for me. They will call and I will meet dr. Valverde
At the elevator on our floor.
We look forward to his visit on thursday.
