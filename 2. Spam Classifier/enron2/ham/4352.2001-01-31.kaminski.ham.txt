Moyez,
We are very anxious to get set up and start using livelink for tracking and
Documenting our projects, so thanks for the reminder. I have put together
An initial list of attributes for our research projects. The list in in the
Attached spreadsheet. It would be great if you can set up these attributes
For us in the test environment. This would allow us to make any obvious
Changes before moving to production. Let me know what your schedule would
Be in rolling this out.
My brief comments in the spreadsheet may not be clear, so feel free to give
Me a call at x 34748 to clarify anything.
Again, thanks for your help.
