Subject: re: programming for rdI model
Michelle,
The project is progressing. Helen has done a great job, finding various flaws
In the initial design (ken' s design) of the access table, and has been going
Back
And forth with ken to modify the table. Since helen can' t devote full time to
This project,
Chris has hired a contractor, cecil stradford, to do the coding. I have
Spoken with
Cecil just now and he says no coding has been done yet. I am trying to
Arrange
A meeting today with cecil, helen, christin (the one who' s overseeing coding
Process in cecil' s company) and myself. Will report back to you on what
Is discussed in the meeting.
Best,
Alex
