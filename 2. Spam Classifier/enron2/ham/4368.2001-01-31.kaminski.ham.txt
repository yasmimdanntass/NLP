Subject: candidate: howard information
Vince - I spoke with london just now.
Here is what I gather vuthy said about howard haughton.
1. He wants a second - round (another interview with enron) - but, with high
Officials (senior management, this time).
2. He didn' t think the interviewers were understanding his technical
Abilities and language.
Good news: he (howard) wants to come back for another interview. I was lead
To believe it went well although, howard believes in protocol.
Bad news: howard in on vacation now for 10 days.
Sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief.
Thanks, vince.
