Subject: interview
Dear mr. Kaminski:
I am very sorry to tell you that I have to cancel my interview with you
Scheduled on feb 9 th. I had a job offer from citadel investment at chicago
With a deadline on feb 5 th. I have been trying to get an extension for the
Past week and unfortunately it failed today. With this very short time
Frame, it is impossible for me and enron' s interviewing process to meet the
Feb 5 th deadline. How unwillingly, I would not be able to visit enron for
After taking citadel' s offer. I hope you will find another candidate from
Our class. There are some people still available. I will be happy to help
You get in touch with those interested.
Please keep in touch and I wish you well in your business!
