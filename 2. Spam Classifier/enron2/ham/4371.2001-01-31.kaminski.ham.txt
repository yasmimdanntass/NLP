You can send? An inquiry to steve leppard.
I had a presentation last night
To garp in houston and did a commercial for the book.

Vince,
I wasn' t sure if I responded to your email, so apologise either for my
Delayed response or repeating myself.
Thanks for the 2 nd order! I believe they have already been? Dispatched.
Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very much for? Following up
With paul. Glad the book was a hit!
On another subject, are there any enron employees in europe who may be
Interested in attending either the energy or the weather course? Or, are
The quants and risk management mostly handled out of houston?
Thanks again, and i' ll forward an invoice on to shirley.
