HI john and vince!
John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth
Below.
I' m in ny now and won' t return until thursday morning. Perhaps it would be
Easiest for john to come to the video conference on thursday (if he' s in
Houston) or via telephone if he' s travelling??
Whatever you both think is best.. Please let me know!
My assistant, melinda mccarty, is setting up the call location at the enron
Building, as well as the dial - in number with donna piazze at wharton.
Melinda, please include john in the distribution of the video conference
Location.
Thanks!

Christie,
As we talked last thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to
Narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for newpower
Including value - added products and services for the future. Before we talk
Again on thursday, we would like to speak with john henderson again to see if
He recommends any specific items he would like us to address.
We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a
Phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next
Video teleconference. We are available the next two days at lpm and 4 pm
Houston time.
We understand that john is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you
Can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his
Expectations.
Thanks,
Enron team 3 (retail)
