Vince,
While I was at hsb, I designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model
That hsb uses for new product development, pricing different reinsurance
Strategies, computing stochastic earnings forecast, and estimating
Probabilistic maintenance & repair costs. The code, written in visual basic &
Ms access belongs to hsb, and I want to replicate it here for our use at
Enron. I would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps
Vasant who was briefed on the model, about how we can use your group for the
Analytical and programming support to get this model re - constructed.
I have screen outputs from the code and vasant thought the re - design and
Construction here at enron is a problem that your group can do. Could you let
Me know when we can setup an hour to discuss?
Thanks,
Rick jones
