Vince,
Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together. Our timetable
Is very short as we need an" approved by enron" version of the paper to don
By next wednesday. Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
Make some additional" writing style" changes but he doesn' t change the
Content.
I' ll give you a call later today to alert you to the e - mail.
Take care,
John
P. S. I had a nice conversation with steve. Sounds like he' s landed a
Pretty good contract with wiley.
