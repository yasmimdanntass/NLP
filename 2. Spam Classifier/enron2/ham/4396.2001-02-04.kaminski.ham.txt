Subject: latest revision
Vince,
I have made bold face edits to the attached document. I still have two edits
To make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version.
Sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn' t use the edit function in word
So I have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper.
I still haven' t made the change regarding the take - or - pay problem (I left
That paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow
Morning). Also, I haven' t added anything regarding the conflict that arose
Over pay for new hires nor have I received the business week e - mail from you.
However, if the paper looks ok to mark palmer we can make these minor edits
On the galley pages of the article.
Thanks
John
P. S. I am very disappointed about the scheduling conflict you have on feb
23 rd. You will be greatly missed but I certainly understand.
