Subject: vince... Feedback from howard on debrief
HI vince, this is exactly what I recieved back from my man in the uk... Pls
Review. Any comments or instructions?
Thank you,
Jeff wesley 949 813 2241 direct
Spoke to howard, he is intereste in speaking to someone higher up the
Foodchain at enron. He got the impression that those people he met would
Report into him. He really needs to speak to someone higher up and discuss
The roles strategic potential.
He is interested mainly in structuring which this role is not. But he
Recognised where it might lead and this would potetially be interesting to
Him but needs to speak to someone who is involved in the strategic direction
Of enrons credit. Com.
Vuthy is aware that enron have intimated they want to see him again. Howard
Has told me there is a lot happening for him both here and in the us. Vuthy
Will arrange to get howard interviewed here in london early next week.
Tks and rgds
Alec
