Vince:
Please include ram vittal to the summer internship list, if you have not
Already done so.
According to my count, that make a total of 8 students from the enron tiger
Team who have a desire to work with enron.
Thanks,
Donna

Heard from them. I would be very willing to reforward my resume, if
Required.
