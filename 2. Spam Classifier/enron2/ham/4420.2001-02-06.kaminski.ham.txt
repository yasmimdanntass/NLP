Subject: good news - cabinet approval for power trading
Team: today union cabinet has approved the proposal of ministry of industry
To allow foreign equity participation in power trading. This was conveyed by
Secretary (power) during his meeting with wade. In normal course, the
Proposal was slated to be coming up for cabinet in next few weeks. Keeping in
View the developments of dpc invoking state guarantee, perhaps cabinet has
Hurried it up.
The exact proposal approved was -" to allow foreign equity participation
Through automatic route upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject to
Prevailing laws."
Irrespective of urgency of this approval to us, the best thing is that we are
Getting the approval without draft electricity bill, 2001 being finalised. As
Most of you are aware, initially the proposal was stalled at fipb level
Pending finalisation of electricity bill. Then it has gone to group of
Ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the cabinet has cleared
It.
Now fipb either issue an approval to enron llc or advise us to avail
Automatic route. We will have one of it, culminating great team work.
Seethayya
