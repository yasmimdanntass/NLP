HI vince,
?
Hope you are fine. I hope that grant' s leaving? Hasn' t affected your group
Too much?

Eprm' s paul bristow has been in touch about a var training course involving
Les, yourself and i. Are you interested? We would be? Extremely happy to work
With you. He was talking about london and houston which I don' t know if it
Fits with your travel schedule. Maybe we can sort something out.

I hope to have the next article with you by early next week.

Best regards as always, and many thanks for your book promotional efforts!

Chris.
