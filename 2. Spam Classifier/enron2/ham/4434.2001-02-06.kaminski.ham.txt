Subject: anshuman shrivastava
Sandeep: vince has asked me to coordinate with margaret daffin in our
International group to ensure that we acquire an ll visa for anshuman. This
Visa has to be in place before he will be able to work in the united states
In any capacity. (anshuman cannot work in the us on a b - 1 visa - - he can only
Come here for business meetings or training.) there are still several items
Remaining to be completed for the l - 1 process. The first is a fairly
Detailed job description for anshuman. Secondly, we will need to know
Whether or not he will either be in a managerial position or whether he will
Be managing a project while he is here in houston. Vince thought that you
Would be best able to provide this information to us, and we would really
Appreciate anything you can do to help us expedite this process.
If you have any questions, please give me a call at x 34804. Thank you for
Your help.
