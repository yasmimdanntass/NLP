Mark!
Please review the attached article and forward your comments/authorization
For its use to john martin at baylor, copying me and vince.
John and vince,
I have a few simple comments:
1. Please use" enron corp." [rather than" enron corporation"]
2. Page 3: as of yesterday, fortune magazine named enron" most innovative"
For the sixth year in a row
3. Page 5: 2 nd paragraph: regarding the" gas bank" concept - - I believe when
Jeff first introduced it, it fell flat. I think john pick' s that up (and
Enron' s subsequent recovery of a version of the concept on p. 6), but it' s
Probably accurate to mention that at first, it didn' t go over.
4. Page 13: re: cindy olson' s comment on a possible 5 x difference between
A" satisfactory" and" superior" vp - - the difference referred to is probably
The" bonus" rather than" compensation" (which, to me, is generally means
Base salary); also, it varies for each review period, as comparative
Performance might vary; further, we might want to run that quote by cindy
Just to make sure she' s ok with it' s publication (she might have no problem
With it whatsoever, but I know for other articles, she' s been more reluctant
To provide that kind of statistic).
5. Page 17 (after annual report quote): I suggest changing" enron' s
Wholesale business... Provides" to"... Businesses.. Provide"; also, rather
Than" enron wholesale" we might want to define this by the term enron uses:
" enron wholesale services"
6. Page 18: 2 nd paragraph: the tense switching from past to present is
Technically correct if read carefully, but seems awkward when reading it
7. Page 19: effective february, jeff skilling is" ceo".
... That' s my 2 - cents worth!! I think the article is great... Even
Interesting (ha!)... Even to non - mba' s like me!!
Thanks!

Vince,
Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together. Our timetable
Is very short as we need an" approved by enron" version of the paper to don
By next wednesday. Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
Make some additional" writing style" changes but he doesn' t change the
Content.
I' ll give you a call later today to alert you to the e - mail.
Take care,
John
P. S. I had a nice conversation with steve. Sounds like he' s landed a
Pretty good contract with wiley.
