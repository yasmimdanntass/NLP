Subject: hello guys,
I' m" bugging you" for your completed questionnaire and for a one - page
Bio/statement on your thoughts on" business edu and the new economy". If
My records are incorrect please re - ship your responses to me. I want to
Put everything together next week so that I can ship it back to everyone.
The questionnaire is attached as well as copies of the bio pages for
Michael froehls and myself (two somewhat different approaches). The idea
Of the latter is just to introduce yourself to the other panelists and give
Them some background on how you are approaching the issues we will discuss.
We will also provide copies to the attendees and use this material for our
Personal introductions at the opening of the panel discussions.
Thanks and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
