Subject: gas model
Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your north american gas
Model. I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
Familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.
I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in december and
Will be back in touch soon. I need to discuss this further with the business
Segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on the long
Term gas model.
Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced his
Name and number. I thought that an e - mail response would suffice for now.
My apologies.
Regards,
John goodpasture
