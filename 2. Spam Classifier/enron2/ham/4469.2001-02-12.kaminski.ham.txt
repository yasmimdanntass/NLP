HI stinson,
Eventually, the team here (giuseppe, eric, myself) has converged to two
Possible dates to propose for a visit:
1) friday, march 2
2) friday, march 9
How do these look on your side?
We' ll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.
I look forward to seeing you again.
Best,
Nick
