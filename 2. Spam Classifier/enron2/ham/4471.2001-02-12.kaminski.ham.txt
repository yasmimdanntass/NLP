Vince,
Thanks for the tradespark article.
I very much appreciate being able to participate in the applied learning
Projects. It has been very stimulating for me. I' ve really enjoyed all the
Projects i' ve worked on with the research group, and ever since my interview
I have had plenty of second thoughts about going back to graduate school.
I' m sure mit will be a good and unique experience, but I wonder if it can
Help me find a job and a community I enjoy as much as I already have here.
If possible, I would like to talk with you and/or stinson about the
Possibility of my staying on the research team, or coming back after the
Fall.
Thanks for your time.
Ken
