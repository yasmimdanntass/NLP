Nick,
Friday, march 9 seems to be better for jim fallon. We are tentatively
Setting meeting with him, paul racicot, and probably arshak sarkissian who is
Heading the ip trading effort. Let me know if you would like to give a
Presentation so we can reserve a room and send invitations.
It will be fun to see you and giuseppe again. I am looking forward to your
Visit.
Regards,
Stinson

HI stinson,
Eventually, the team here (giuseppe, eric, myself) has converged to two
Possible dates to propose for a visit:
1) friday, march 2
2) friday, march 9
How do these look on your side?
We' ll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.
I look forward to seeing you again.
Best,
Nick
