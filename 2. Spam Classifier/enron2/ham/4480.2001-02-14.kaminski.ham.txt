Subject: termination payments - ees energy outsource agreements
Vince, attached is a very brief white paper on the issue of termination
Payments for facility closures and sales. I would like to discuss this
Concept with you and some of your people in the coming days to establish
Whether this has merit and how we might proceed. My assistant, cheryl
Brashier, will set up some time with you.
Thanks.
