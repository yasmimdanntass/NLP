Michelle,
Cecil and david' s code was correct but could not match ken' s spreadsheet
Output due to a slight mis - specification in ken' s excel spreadsheet. The code
Was then modified to conform with ken' s specification and results very close
To that of ken were obtained. As of now ken' s modifying his spreadsheet to
Re - run the results, the original correct code will be restored, and we will
See what
Happens then. Anyway this is rather encouraging.
Best,
Alex
