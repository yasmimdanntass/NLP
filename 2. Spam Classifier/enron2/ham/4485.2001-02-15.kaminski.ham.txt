Subject: weather course
Vince,
?
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
Weather derivatives course (all from enron) so far.? We have a couple more
That have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final
Decision.? If no one else signs up, chris and les thought that you guys
Could probably get through the first day pretty easily,? And thus thought it
May be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material (pricing) only at enron
(doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
Large side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We
Can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?
?
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know where
We stand on final numbers by next wednesday.
