Subject: avistar users and allocated charges
I have several queries re the avister charges for london, primarily because
The spreadsheet is based on a total of 24 london users. We have a total of
14 avistar users installed in london.
I believe the following london departments may have been charged for the
Incorrect number of users:
Fin , l trading - $74, 418. 83 based on 4 units but have 5 users
Rate & currency (john greene not listed?)
342 - 100467
Softs mg - $42, 857. 23 based on 4 units but have only 1 user
1105 - 120415 (nigel majury)
Credit derivitives - $16, 168. 42 based on 2 units but none installed
0342 - 102843 (3 users on via video pilot)
Liquids - $56, 589. 46 based on 7 units but only 6 installed
872 c - 104546 (niamh clarke no longer based in london)
Shankman london - $16, 168. 42 based on 2 units but none installed
0342 - 103058 (brad hitch/merrill thomas no longer in dept.)
Eel - exec - $8, 084. 21 based on 1 unit for john sherriff who is
0342 - 100309 on via video pilot - avistar not installed
Legal london - $8, 084. 21 based on 1 unit for michael brown - avistar
0342 - 100348 not installed
London it - $16, 168. 42 based on two units but only one required
0342 - 100348 to administer system
The above figures are based on an original average $10, 276 per seat.
However, a base change from 24 to 14 seats would increase the per seat charge
To $17, 616.
We also ought to look at charging out the isdn calls charges for the avistar
System (in the region of $187, 000 for 4 months).
