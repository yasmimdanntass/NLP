Vince,
I must apologize. I have not had time to look over the proposal in any
Detail. When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was
Still pre - business plan stage. He has since sent me some ideas and
Information. I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political
Issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability.
Give me the weekend to look over the information.
Thanks,
Mark
