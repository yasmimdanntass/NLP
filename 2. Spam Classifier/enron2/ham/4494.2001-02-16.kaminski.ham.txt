Julie,
Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.
I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
Course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.

Great.? Just to let you know, we decided not to wait on the indecisive ones,
And postponed the open course.? It' s yours, whatever you want:? 1 day
(specific to what you feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, hyatt or
Enron, or not at all.? I hope this doesn' t cause problems for you.? Special
Deal, for sure.? I owe my godfather.

Julie,
That' s definitely an option.
We can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal for enron
And increase the #of people attending. I am forwarding your message to
Our weather desk.
Vince
Joe,
What do you think about it?

Vince,
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
Weather derivatives course (all from enron) so far. We have a couple more
That have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final
Decision. If no one else signs up, chris and les thought that you guys
Could probably get through the first day pretty easily, and thus thought it
May be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material (pricing) only at enron
(doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
Large? Side)? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
Can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it. We will know? Where
We stand on final numbers by next wednesday.
Julie
