Subject: howard confirmation
HI vince, i' m on vacation from friday (today) until tuesday. Rachel/london
Sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention - did
They get it right to meet you satisfaction? I hope your interview goes well
With howard too. It' s all set.
Any feedback on the guys from ford credit and citigroup/oxford university? I
Own them outright - no other firms involved! Fyi: my fees are always much less
On these candidates (exclusive ownership by myself) as there are no middlemen
Involved from these" other firms". I luckily have been attracting very
Talented candidates with just doing business" as myself" rather than mri. I
Am very encouraged. Please check them out, vince... As you know - I always
Send you them first then on to my other clients - if you reject them.
Bye vince, thank you for the business!
Jeff
Ps - use my cellphone if you want me (the next 4 days) for anything; i' m here
For you - 949 813 2241
