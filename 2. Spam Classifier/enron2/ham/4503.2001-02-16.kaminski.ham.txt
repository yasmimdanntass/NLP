Subject: hello all
Just wanted to share the list of" one - page" bios and summary statements
That I have collected to this point. I have two more yet to come and will
Share them asap. Have a great weekend and I look forward to seeing
Everyone in" sunny/warm waco" next week.
By the way, bill petty has challenged everyone to a 40 minute jog along the
River on friday morning at 6: 45 a. M. So bring your jogging gear. I also
Have heard from very reliable sources that bennett stewart is the odds on
Favorite to" win the race" (cynthia leaked the story that he' s been in
Training now for several months).
I' ll also be sending you driving/parking, etc. Instructions early next week.
Have a great weekend,
John
