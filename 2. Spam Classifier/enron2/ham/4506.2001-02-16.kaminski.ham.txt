HI vince!
Thanks for the information below!
I spoke with tom piazze today. I' ll be meeting with him at 3: 30 on the 20 th
To discuss the webI contract. I' ll also be meeting with wharton' s broadband
(technical people) before our meeting with the students. Further, I hope to
Meet with the people in charge of the business plan competition.
Tom suggested you might want to call howard kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly
Stop in to see him while we are at wharton.
I' ll be getting to wharton sometime tuesday; i' ll try to get a reservation at
The inn at penn. I' ll then be leaving early wednesday morning by train to
New york.
Shall we meet in tha lobby at the inn at penn before going to meet the
Students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6 pm - ish) - - say, 5: 30?
Please let me know!
Also, we still need to give wharton an answer as to whether we' re interested
In another $50, 000 investment in efellows.
Thanks vince!
Have a great wekend!

Please note that the remaining videoconferences scheduled with enron have
Been changed to teleconferences due to the difficulties we have experienced.
The host has agreed and we will, therefore, continue with teleconferences in
The same locations/dates as noted above.
Any questions, please contact the fap office.
Thanks,
Donna
