Subject: hiring of wharton tiger teams members for summer associate
Positions in research
Vince:
Just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the wharton
Tiger teams 1 & 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer
Associate program. You stated that you could take all members into your
Research group for the summer. Kristin gandy is now in the process of
Obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the
Individuals on teams 1 & 3. Some of these individuals may have interviewed
With us during the campus process. If they did and were turned down by the
Team for a summer position, we will not extend offers to those individuals.
Otherwise, if you are willing to take the additional tiger team members into
Your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working
With these students, then the associate program will facilitate those offers.
At mid summer and the end of the summer, these wharton mbas' performance will
Be evaluated and cross - calibrated with other summer associates to determine
Whether they receive an offer to join the full - time associate program.
Offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high
Performance ratings.
As soon as kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines
Which members did not already interview, she will get out both a verbal and
Offer to them.
As follow - up, jana giovannini, manager of staffing in career development,
Will staff those that accept our offer from this tiger team list into your
Group for the summer.
Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.
Regards,
Celeste roberts
