Please note that the remaining videoconferences scheduled with enron have
Been changed to teleconferences due to the difficulties we have experienced.
The host has agreed and we will, therefore, continue with teleconferences in
The same locations/dates as noted above.
Any questions, please contact the fap office.
Thanks,
Donna
