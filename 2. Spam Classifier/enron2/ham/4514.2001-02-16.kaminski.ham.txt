Subject: re: research leads
Hello team 1,
I spoke with larry gagliardI on the crude/refinery products desk this morning
And he agreed to talk with you after 12: 30 today or after 2: 30 any other
Weekday. He is very familiar with the other platforms and should be a great
Resource. Larry suggested that you surf eol to find names of power and/or
Natural gas traders, and call them up. Please let me know if you have
Difficulty finding/contacting folks this way and I will see if I can help.
Larry' s office number is 713 - 853 - 0543, and his email is
Larry. Gagliardi@ enron. Com.
Good luck
Ken
