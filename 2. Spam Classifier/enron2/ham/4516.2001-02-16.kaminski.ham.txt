Sandeep: further to my voice mail to you today, I will meet with anshuman at
10: 30 am and will keep his documents in a file.
However, without some type of job offer in the us, we cannot move forward
With an ll visa for him and if you believe he will not be returning to the us
To work, then we really do not need to get him the ll at this time.
If the circumstances change, please let me know.
Margaret
