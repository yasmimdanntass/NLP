Subject: schedules, maps, etc.
Gentlemen:
Attached is a schedule of activities as well as maps and driving
Instructions for those who are driving to campus friday morning. The dress
For friday is casual (no ties, sport shirts and jackets if you wish).
For those of you who have asked about thursday night' s dinner please note
That we have pushed it up to 6 - 8 pm at ninfa' s mexican restaurant. At this
Point I plan to pick up bennett s. And don c. From the marriott before 6
And will do the same for anyone else (let me know). The restaurant is in
Easy walking distance of the hilton and marriott.
Please note the times for your individual interviews/video taping on
Friday. Some of you are leaving early so we are taping you from 11 - 12
Friday morning while others are being taped after the program is over.
I' m sure i' ve forgotten something so you' ll probably get more e - mails.
However, this should take care of the primary stuff. I' m really looking
Forward to seeing all of you and to hearing your thoughts in the workshops.
More later,
John
