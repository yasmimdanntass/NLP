According to the information that christie patrick emailed me the following

Vince kaminski' s request should receive offers for summer associate positions
Located in his research group.
Tiger team #1

2. Mallik deepa
3. Jack rejtman
4. Kim whitsel
5. Tulika bhalia
6. Nicholas levitt - I am uncertain based on the emailed information from
Christie if this is a student or a ta? Can either vince or christie verify
This information please.

1. Clay degiacinto
2. Steve lessar
3. Vittal maheshram
4. Omar bassel
5. Dennis feerick
6. Marc" jason" cummins
The following candidates interviewed with the regular on campus wharton team
On 2/5/01 and were not passed onto the second round interviews. With that
Information I am not sure if we will offer those candidates positions for the
Summer program?
1. Kim whitsel - team #1
2. Clay degiacinto - team #3
3. Gustavo pallazzI - team #2
4. Edson otanI - team #2
I also have that heather thorne is the teaching assistant and donna piazze is
The professor for the project. Can you also verify that information?
Vince if you would please verify and give me the okay via email then I will
Contact these candidates by phone to inform them they will be receiving an
Offer from enron. But before I do anything I want to make sure this
Information is correct and I am not excluding or adding any members that
Should receive an offer.
Thank you,
