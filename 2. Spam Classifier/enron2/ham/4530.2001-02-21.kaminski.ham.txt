Vince,
I' ve distributed the info on the course. Gary taylor, the head of marketing
Said that there were perhaps two people he' d like to send, and he thought
That the teachers would be able to benefit from having people from the
Weather derivatives desk in attendance, but that the price of $1100 a person
Was too steep. Gary (being the head of marketing that he is) would like to
See if there would be some special deal that could be arranged for people
From the weather desk, but he doesn' t want to cross the line.
Joe

Joe,
This is the most recent offer from lacima
(weather derivatives course). What do you think?

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the hyatt anyway).
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the
Weather desk' s idea is probably different?): for the one day, $1100 per
Person. If you think that there will be around 10 people or more, then we
Can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.
Thanks vince
Julie
Ps - of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started
Responding that they wished to attend. Ugh!

Julie,
Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.
I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
Course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.

Vince,
Great. Just to let you know, we decided not to wait on the indecisive
Ones, and postponed the open course. It' s yours, whatever you want: 1
Day (specific to what you feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, hyatt
Or enron, or not at all. I hope this doesn' t cause problems for you.
Special deal, for sure. I owe my godfather.
Julie

Julie,
That' s definitely an option.
We can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal for
Enron
And increase the #of people attending. I am forwarding your message to
Our weather desk.
Vince
Joe,
What do you think about it?

Vince,
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for
The
Weather derivatives course (all from enron) so far. We have a couple more
That have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final
Decision. If no one else signs up, chris and les thought that you guys
Could probably get through the first day pretty easily, and thus thought
It
May be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
Large side)? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
Can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it. We will know where
We stand on final numbers by next wednesday.
Julie
