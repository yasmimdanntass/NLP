Subject: a resume for john lavorato
Molly,
Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
A trading position. Interviews with john lavorato, jeff shankman,
Gary hickerson, stinson gibner.
I talked to him in new york and he is considering
Other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think john will like him more than punit.
Thanks
