Subject: re: times 2 filing units
Pat: out co #is 0413, rc #is 107043. Please deliver them to eb 19 c 2.
Also, please let me know when they are going to be delivered as we have to
Unload the lateral file cabinets that are currently in that room. Will the
Men who deliver the times 2 units remove the lateral files? Thanks. Anita
