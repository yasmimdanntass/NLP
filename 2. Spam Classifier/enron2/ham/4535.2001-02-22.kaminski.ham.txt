Subject: credit reserve simulation for ees
Amitava and seksan have identified the source of the discrepancy between the
Option prices calculated by the credit - reserve model and the stand - alone
Spreadsheet model used in deal pricing. We expect to put a fix in place by
Tomorrow.
In response to your desire to see more output from credit reserve simulation,
I have identified a list of possible items that may be of interest to you for
Credit pricing.
1. Potential exposure across time
2. For each simulated credit event, display:
Default time
Exposure - - is deal - by - deal breakdown of any interest?
Commodity forward curves (or spot price?) at default time
I would appreciate it if you could let me know your wish list at your
Earliest.
Thanks,
RabI de
