HI paul,
?
Thanks for the e - mail. Sorry I missed your calls this morning but I was at
The dentist, where its difficult to speak at the best of times!
?
I' m sorry but it doesn' t look like we will be able to commit to? The eprm var
Conference. We are still a small company and the trip would tie us up for
Over a week. I' m sure you' ll understand that internally we just can' t
Justify? The two senior members of the company? To be away on eprm business
And to have to pay money from our own pocket? To run this course for you. It
Was a difficult decision originally to? Offer our services at expenses only
With no fee, but we did so for the potential opportunity to work some more
With vince.
?
Good luck in your search for alternative course leaders.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.

HI chris,
?
Just an extra note regarding the course. If the reimbursements are suitable
I would like to finalise the line - up asap (vince and a european enron
Representative). If you were unable to participate I would need to offer
Alternative invitations by the end of this week.
?
All the best,
?
Paul??

HI chris,
?
I' ve been looking at the forward plan and the total budget for speaker
Expenses is 5500 pounds (us keyboard, no pound sign). At current exchange
Rates this comes to a little over 15, 000 australian dollars. I would be
Happy to cover your expenses up to this figure.
?
The course is scheduled to run in amsterdam (not london as originally
Planned) and houston. The dates are slightly flexible? To? Work with your
Travel schedules. For instance, would you prefer to travel to
Sydney - houston - amsterdam - sydney, or in the opposite direction?
?
If you could contact me to? Let me know if this would? Enable you to commit
To the course, I would be delighted to forward the notes from the research.
I would plan to then work on the outline until march lst. I look forward to
Speaking with you soon.
?
Best wishes,
?
Paul bristow?

HI chris,
?
I would like to confirm the dates of some of the forthcoming eprm events:
?
Effective var and stress testing techniques for the us energy industry. This
Event will run on the 21 & 22 may in london and the 28 & 29 may in houston.
Michele du berry (director of conferences) and I are looking at how we have
Structured the training courses and are keen to present a different outline
Than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2 - 3 trainers
Per venue, rather than with 7 - 8 as we have done in the past. If you and les
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible with vince
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater detail.
?
Energy & power risk management, europe. Our largest annual european event is
Scheduled to between september 19 - 21. Victoria kerridge will be producing
This event from the london office and will be starting research in two
Weeks. I am going to be providing her with a brief and will ensure that she
Has your contact details.
?
I have also been finalizing the details for the annual energy & power risk
Management event in houston. This will take place on may 14 th & 15 th and is
Close to completion. I would be happy to provide you with more details,
Without potentially running the risk of overloading your schedule with a
Number of events in a short space of time (var and eprm, houston). My
Priority is to secure trainers for our var course.
?
If you would be interested in any of the events listed, I would be happy to
Talk with you this week. My direct line is 212 925 6990, extension 225.
?
Best wishes,
?

HI paul,
?
Just a note so that you have my address. Do you have dates for the us and
European conferences yet? I' m sure that we can arrange other work at the
Same time to offset the expenses of speaking at these events if you want us
To participate.
?
You also mentioned a training course on var and the energy area. We had an
Eprm article last year with vince on a comparison of the different
Techniques on a trial portfolio that might form the basis of something
Useful. Anyway, let me know.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
