Vince and ravi,
Attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the university of
Chicago with an ms in mathematics. His specialty is financial mathematics
And his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that i
Understand your group to do, vince. He is extremely interested in enron and
Contacted me because I am an alum of the college at the u of c. I gather he
Didn' t go through enron' s typical recruiting process for analysts or
Associates because his background is more technical, than commercial. He
Acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you
Can tell that he is young. He would therefore be willing to start as an
Analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non - rotating position, but
His interest is in doing the kind of work that you do, vince, and ravi, i
Know you have a similar background.
Please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you.
If so, feel free to contact him directly. He would like to start work this
Summer after graduating in june.
Thanks for your time and I hope this is useful to you.
Regards,
Laura
