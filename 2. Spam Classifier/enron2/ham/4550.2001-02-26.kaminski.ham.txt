Subject: discount rates and risk capital
Dear vince:
I spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on
Determining discount rates than I originally anticipated. It is somewhat
Surprising, but there really isn' t much academic work that I am aware of
That addresses these issues.
Very briefly,
1. I think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk
Capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate.
2. I think it is important to model enron' s opportunity cost of capital and
How that changes over time. The liquidity of a project will affect its
Value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital
Changes over time. There is also likely to be a relation between duration
And discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron' s
Opportunity cost of capital.
3. I have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify
Some of the issues that I have raised.
Please take a look at the attached document. You might find this somewhat
Confusing, so I will give you a call later in the week to discuss this.
Please let me know when you will be free. I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Sheridan
