Vince,
Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two
Groups that a subscription to the" institute for international finance" is
Worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the
Cost. Is a $16 k share ok for your group? We' ll do $32 k on our end, and then
Try and sell some of our share to my european counterpart once he gets better
Established with a bigger budget.

Scott - could you give vince a call or an email to recommend that he kick in
16 k for the institute for international finance? We would pay 32 k (maybe get
Jim roth to pick up some down the road).

I haven' t heard back from vince yet on the price, but we definitely need to
Continue our access to iif. Can you count us in for a slice of the cost and
Advise me how many others depts you can recruit to help pay the annual fees.
Once you have a final count, it may reduce our costs in research. Thanks,
Gek

If you need access to consensus data occasionally let me know and I can pull
It for you. Let me know when you get an answer on iif. I will also be
Looking for others to buy in.

Robert,
Thanks for itemizing the costs. We have decided to cancel the oxford
Analytica, as we receive a consensus forecast for currency and inflation from
Another source. Regarding iif, it is an important source for us. I will
Discuss the costs within the research group and advise you of how we will
Proceed.

HI maureen and gwyn -
On the oxford analytica front, i' m glad you have found the service useful.
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more
Users to have access. Our current contract is for $50 k or $10 k per user per
Year. We can charge $10 k back to you.
On the iif front, the invoice for $47 k is due at the end of the month. Here
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of
Our competitive analysis colleagues in london), leaving $15 k for you to cover.
Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of
Sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus i
Need to allocate some of our costs from oxan and iif to other projects.
Let me know what you think about this proposal. Maureen, congratulations on
Your secondment to enron metals (gwyn mentioned it to me). Fyi, our
Colleague jim roth is providing competitive analysis support to joe gold and
John sherriff on that project from london.
