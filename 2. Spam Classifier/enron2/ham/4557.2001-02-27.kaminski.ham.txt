Subject: dispatch within maharashtra
Jim,
Please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run
Giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra. I have also sent
The presentation we made to you to wade. He is to get back on when would be
An appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me.
Vince, stinson and I have placed ourselves on rebecca' s calender for friday,
And we will make the complete pitch to her. It would be great if you too
Could be present at the meeting. If it is possible, please do let me know.
On the attached slides, please note that:
The slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff, mseb liability for
The entire capacity payment is not considered.
The henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra
When variable o & m costs, fixed o though in
Some months (jan) it goes as high as $69 mm. Hence, overall, mseb can pay
For the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided, they are not paying
For the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant.
In conclusion, therefore, mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a
Seasonal basis. This means that the power remaining to be sold to other
States is the difference between that and 2184 mw.
However, since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally, it may mean
That we need to market seasonal products to other states, not long term
Blocks.
These are our conclusions. We may continue to work some more on the fuel and
Hedging side. If you have any more questions for me, please let me know,
Else for now there will not be any new henwood runs.
Regards,
Sandeep.
