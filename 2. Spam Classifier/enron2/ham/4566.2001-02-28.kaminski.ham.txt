Subject: financial mathematics grad from u of c
Vince and ravi,
Below is a message from the student whose resume I forwarded to you earlier
This week. Vince, I suspect he may be best suited for your group, but i
Don' t know what your current needs are. Unfortunately, i' m leaving enron and
My last day is friday of this week, so I won' t be around to help this guy
Through the process or host him when he is here. Can either of you suggest
Someone I can ask to handle this for you if you' re interested in him?
Thanks.
Regards,
Laura
