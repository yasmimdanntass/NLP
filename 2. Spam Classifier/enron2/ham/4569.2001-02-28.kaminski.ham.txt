Subject: rice course
Vince
I am an adjunct professor at rice, working with wil uecker in executive
Education. With your concurence, I would like to sit in your energy
Derivatives course. I understand from wil that there are 38 students
Registered for the course. If you consent, would you let me know what
Material I need.
Thank you,
