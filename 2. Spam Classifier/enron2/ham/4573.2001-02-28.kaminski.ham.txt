Subject: re:" analytical" var implementation in risktrac
Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of
" analytical" var in risktrac.
Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate var for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0. 2% as
Mentioned by rick buy)
And our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as mean tail loss) to
The board.
The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested
Already so there will be no problems
With the algorithm itself.
We need to get together and discuss it implementation.
What do you think?
