Moyez,
Thanks, I will try and collect the information today. Vasant and I were
Thinking that it would make sense to let people try the application under the
Test environment for a few weeks. Then we can incorporate any additional
Suggestions and move to production around the first week in april.
Our meeting room does have a screen and network connection, and we can
Profide an lcd projector as well. How about thursday of next week?
Thanks,
Stinson

Stinson,
Sorry to have to do this to you but I need some additional information in
Order to add these users to the research projects group. Please use the
Attached template to capture the information needed and forward to me at your
Convenience. Also, the group has only been set up in the test environment.
Do you want to add the users to the test environment or are you ready to
Migrate to production?
As far as the demo is concerned, I , ll be happy to accommodate your group.
How many people do you expect at the demo and does the room have a display
Screen and network connection? Let me know which thursday you would like me
To conduct the demo and I , ll be there.

Moyez,
Can you add access to the following users for the livelink research projects
Database? Also, would you be available to give a short demonstration and
Tutorial on how to use livelink for our group? We hold a lunch meeting
Each thursday from 11: 30 - 1: 00 in 30 cl at which there is usually a short
Presentation on a topic of interest. I think it would be very useful for the
Group to have an overview of how to use the tool before everyone jumps into
It. The presentation can be quite informal. Let me know if you would be
Available in the next couple of weeks.
