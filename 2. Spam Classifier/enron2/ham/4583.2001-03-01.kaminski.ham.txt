Subject: 1997 risk paper on pricing of electricity derivatives
Hello vince,
My name is bernard murphy - I received your e - mail address from les clewlow,
Who was my phd supervisor at the financia options research centre at warwick
Business school. I' ve just finished my phd on electricity price jump
Diffusions: a theoretical and empirical study in incomplete markets -
Hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing. I
Was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
Come to my attention:
" the challenge of pricing & risk - managing electricity derivatives", the us
Power market, risk publications, pp. 149 - 171.
And les suggested that I contact you directly (les is travelling at present
And doesn' t have an electronic copy available) to request an e - copy.
Incidentally, I am lecturer in finance/financial mathematics at university
Of limerick (ireland) and have taken a year out to work for caminus uk,
Where I am working on introducing and developing a markets - based approach
(spark - spread) to real asset valuations in the uk power industry.
Thanks in advancve
Bernard murphy
