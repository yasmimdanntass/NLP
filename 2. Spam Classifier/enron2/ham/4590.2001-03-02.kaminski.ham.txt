Subject: research support in london
Vince,
Steve leppard informed my today that he will be moving to enron metals. I
Think that leaves a leadership hole in research here. When that happens in a
Place like this, resources get diverted to the squeakiest wheel. Do you have
Any advice? I am concerned that london continues to lag behind in the
Implementation and analysis of var - most commodities are on spreadsheets and
There is not a lot of attention on calibration, analyzing output, refining,
Improving etc..
Pls advise
Ted
