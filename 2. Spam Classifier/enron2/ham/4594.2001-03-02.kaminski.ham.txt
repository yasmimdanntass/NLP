Subject: re: summer internship
Dr. Kaminski,
Thank you very much.
Of course, i' ll be happy to have an opportunity
To work at such a wonderful company.
I was contacting with surech raghavan at deal bench team,
And was going to express my appreciation to you again
After settling down process with them.
For the period of working,
I still need to coordinate with my advisor and
May need to adjust according to that.
But anyway, i' ll try to coordinate smoothly.
Please let me know whether I should keep contacting
With deal bench team,
For working period and
For misc. Living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.
I appreciate you so much again,
For arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.
All this opportunity will not be available to me,
Without your kind help.
Warm regards,
Jinbaek
