Perfect. Thanks, vince.
In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job
Talks to include others. Again, since you are a member of the risk
Management chair search committee (you may not know of this official
Capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will
Be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.
I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.
