Subject: vlady gorny
Barbara,
I called vlady gorny and explained that the presentation by jorion is not
Offered
Under the umbrella of the seminar sponsored by enron and that it is a
Closed meeting for the school faculty.
I don' t think that enron would open its job interviews to rice observers
Who expressed interest and I made this comment to vlady. He is ok with this.
You can let his program director know that I have explained to vlady
That it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be
Invited.
Please, let me know the details of the dinners.
Vince
