Subject: a request
Vince,
I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with john
Lehoczky and a phd student. We trying to apply recent advances in monte
Carlo for american options to value swing and other options with multiple
Early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets. I know in
General that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts,
Both real as welll as financial. Would it be possible for you, either via
Email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such
Instruments? We would like our examples to look realistic. We also want to
Make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.
Thanks in advance,
Duane
