Subject: summer offer
Bhala,
I double checked with hr, and the offer you received is in line with what we
Are offering to other graduate level summer interns. If you have better
Offers, I certainly wouldn' t hold it against you for taking them over what we
Are offering, but we can' t really justify raising the offer at this time.
We can re - imburse you for shipping expenses up to a reasonable amount, say
$500, if you need to ship things down. You can just save the receipts for
These expenses and shirley can fill out the necessary expense forms.
Best regards,
Stinson
