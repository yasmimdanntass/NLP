Subject: freese notis
Mike:
We are currently being billed for freese notis weather. I will need to
Allocate these charges to the appropriate cost center. If you would like to
Continue this service I could allocate it directly to your cost center or
Send you the bill directly. If you know of anyone else who uses this
Application please let me know and I will split the cost among the
Departments.
Thank you,
