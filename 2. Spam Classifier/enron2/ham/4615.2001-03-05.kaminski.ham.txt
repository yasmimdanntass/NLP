Yes, the offer is coming. It may take a few days to process it, but you can
Count on it.

Vince:
I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven' t heard from
Enron about an offer for summer employment. I do have other offers with
Other energy companies that I must respond to this week. Could you let me
Know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.
Sincerely,
Kimberly whitsel
