Iris:
I forwarded the information to donna lowry in our compliance dept. However,
I am afraid she had bad news.
Enron would sponsor the renewals, but the us securities group does not
Recognize uk securities exams without further testing here in the us.
She said she would get back with you and explain it in greater detail. But,
From what I understand, you will need to take some exam here before renewing.
When you hear from her let me know.
