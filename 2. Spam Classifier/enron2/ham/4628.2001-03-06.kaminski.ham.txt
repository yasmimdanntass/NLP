Vince,
Rob and I would like to coordinate a meeting with one of your research people
To review the spread option calculation from the exotica options library.
We' re pricing a spread option deal in nyc and have some questions related to
The formula, greeks, etc. Please let me know who might be available to sit
With us for about 1/2 hour. Thanks
