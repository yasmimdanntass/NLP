Subject: recommendation letter
Dear vince,
How are you?
I am just wondering whether you have received the
Email I sent to you a couple of weeks back. In that
Email, I asked whether you would have time to write me
A recommendation letter to support my application for
A master program (mathematical finance) in columbia
University this coming fall. If you will be able to
Write the letter, would you please let me know?
Thanks a lot.
Best regards,
Vincent tang
