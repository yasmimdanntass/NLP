Robert johnston has asked me to charge vince' s department for 1/3 of the cost
Of the annual subscription to iif. The annual cost is $47 k. Therefore the
Cost for 1/3 is $15, 666. 67. This information is for maureen raymond' s use.
I will be happy to process the invoice for payment but in order for me to do
So, I will need the proper coding for vince' s department.
Please let me know if you are agreeable to this. If you have questions, you
May wish to contact robert johnston directly at 3 - 9934.
Thanks,
Sharon
