Subject: hello all
Update:
Preparations for the upcoming texas finance festival iiI are about complete
And I just wanted to update you on the hotel reservations information. You
Will need to make your reservation before march 20 to be assured of getting
A room in our reserved block. Also, for" counting" purposes I need
Everyone' s registration form completed. Many of you (and a lot of new
Faces) have already sent them in but some may not have, so...
Lots of fun stuff is planned so come prepared for a very relaxing and
Productive weekend!
