HI again,
I had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
Agriculture - related deals and on weather derivatives.
I mentioned to them about bernard' s working at mckinsey and
Specializing in the agriculture area.
We thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and/or met
To discuss possible collaborative efforts.
Will you please forward this email on to bernard to see if this
Might be of interest to him?
Thanks,
Iris
