Dear mr. Kindall,
I just wanted to let you know that I appreciated the time you gave me on
Monday, and that I am very interested in pursuing a career at enron. I feel
That my risk management and treasury experience would prove to be valuable
At your firm, and I would very much like to continue discussions with you if
A suitable position becomes open.
Thanks again for the taking the time to chat with me, and I look forward to
Hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Bill anderson
