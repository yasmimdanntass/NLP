Subject: enron earth day" trash bash"
Enron is hosting a special event on saturday, march 31 st. The first annual
Enron" trash bash" to clean up the banks of buffalo bayou between shepherd
Drive and sam houston park.
I am chairing the check - in team which consists of:
Registering all of the volunteers
Handing out enron t - shirts and caps
Passing out gloves and garbage bags
Making clean up section assignments
For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext.
30329.
Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along buffalo bayou and pick up
Trash. This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs
Youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop. It will also be fun. They
Will have live bands, lyou get an enron t - shirt and enron baseball cap, lunch
Will be served at sam houston park and there are a lot of good door prizes.
If you want to volunteer for the" trash bash" clean up, just show up at sam
Houston park on saturday, march 31, 2001, at 8 am to register. Clean up
Starts at 9 am and lunch will be served at 11: 00 am and after lunch door
Prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your
Part for houston' s waterway environment.
I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. And help
Enron clean up the environment.
Thanks, anita
