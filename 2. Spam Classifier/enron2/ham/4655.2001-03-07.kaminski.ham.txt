Subject: re:" expected tail loss" for equity portfolio
Everybody,
I attached here the equity portfolio var spreadsheet model (version x).
The improvement over the previous version (1 x) is that it calculates
An additional measure of risk - expected tail loss.
Expected tail loss is the expectation of the loss under the condition that
Losses exceed var. As you know equity var model allows you to calculate var
For the percentile specified in the input sheet.
Now you have to click 2 more buttons on the" varinput" sheet:
" calculate gamma and delta" and" fast var".
Isaac, please run the model to make sure it works for you.
Regards,
Tanya
