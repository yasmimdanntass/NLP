Subject: eol data mining
Vince,
Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of
Interest:
The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different
Counterparties -
(note the large part that aquila plays!)
The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week
Between the hours of 8: 00 am and 4: 00 pm for different categories of product.
Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded
Volumes." products" is for the remaining categories.
There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon
Software is now available, and can be reached at the following url:
Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering
Regarding eol?
I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are
There any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?
Thanks,
Tom
