Dear mr. Kaminski,
Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to receiving a
Copy of your article.
I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether enron provides
Research grants to individuals who are working in the area of energy risk
Management. Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to estimate
Electricity spot price.
In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down the
Line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because enron is my
Dream job.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you,
Yours sincerely,
