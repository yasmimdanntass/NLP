Subject: weekly report
HI david,
I understand that you were slightly upset over a comment kevin kindall made
In one of his weekly reports. The wording was unfortunate, but the intention
Was never to disparage anybody. It is just that since research gets data
From a large number of sources, we feel obligated to the data donor to ask
Any requester for clarification of need. I completely understand that rac
Typically has access to much sensitive information and they have a right to
Know much information. We just want to make sure there is open flow of
Information (it is in everybody' s best interests and the company' s best
Interests) and that everybody is aware of how data is flowing.
Best wishes,
Vasant
