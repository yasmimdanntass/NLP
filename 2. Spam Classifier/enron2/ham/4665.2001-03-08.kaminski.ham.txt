Shirley,
We interviewed by phone karthik and would now like to bring him for a visit
To enron. Can you either arrange it or forward to hr for them to arrange,
Whichever is best. While here karthik should probably talk with
Zimin, paulo, bob, vasant, krishna, vince
And anyone else vince wants to add to the list.
Thanks,
Stinson
His resume is attached below. His phone #is 765 494 2181.
