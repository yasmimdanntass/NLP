Subject: re: interview with enron corp. Research
Dear shirley,
Thanks for your letter and invitation. Next week we have a spring break at
Uh, so I will be pretty flexible. Is next tuesday fine? Almost any time. If
Not, any other day next week will work for me. Starting march 19 I will
Teach again, and it will be harder (but not impossible) to find a good time
For interview with enron.
Adam
