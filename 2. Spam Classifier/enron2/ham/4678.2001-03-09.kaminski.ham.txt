Subject: meeting with mr. Sud
Rebecca,
As we had spoken on the phone, I met with mr. Kk sud, a retired secretary in
The govt. Of india yesterday. This meeting was arranged at vince' s request,
Since vince had been approached by mr. Sud' s son who is a student at rice
(where vince teaches a course). The younger mr. Sud had wanted someone at
Enron to meet with his father who was visiting houston, and is currently an
Advisor (post retirement from the government) to the prime minister' s office.
This was my first meeting, and I have no background check on the person.
However, the meeting was interesting, and mr. Sud conveyed to me in
Confidence that the indian govt. Is very interested in solving the dabhol
Issue. He also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of
Ntpc buying all the power from dabhol, but that this was still under wraps.
I have no way of judging the genuineness of this person, but he claimed to
Have been secretary in the ministry of defence for some 16 years, which is a
Very important post in india. The information he was conveying seemed so
Important that vince and I decided to update you on the same by phone this
Morning.
Mr. Sud is leaving houston on monday so, as discussed, I will see if he can
Meet with you on saturday morning.
Regards,
Sandeep.
