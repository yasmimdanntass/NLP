Dear mr. Kaminski,
Since I am just about starting off on my research, I do not have any papers
Published in this area. But I do plan to address this shortcoming pretty
Soon. I have a couple of other papers against my name, but they are not
Worth any serious mention.
I thank you for taking time off your busy schedule to write to me. I will
Keep you posted about my progress.
Thank you,
Yours sincerely,
