Subject: re: green card
Vince,
Thanks for initiating this information flow. I think the confusion is coming
From the question of if an fl can apply for green card or not. To my
Knowledge and to the knowledge of international student services in my
University, yes I can apply. Anyway, thanks again and I am sure we' ll find a
Good answer for this question since here is enron.
Sevil,

Sevil,
I believe you and margret daffin have spoken about the next steps for your
Green card. You will need to start working on you hib at the begining of
October 2001.
If there is any confusion on my part please let me know.

Below is dicussion between margret daffin and sevil in an e: mail january 26,
2001:
" sevil: first of all we have to get you an hib visa before we can work on
Getting you the green card.
After you get your opt, contact me sometime in the summer and I will start
Working on your hib visa which we will obtain in approx. October, 2001. We
Cannot start the green card process when you are still on an fl visa - you
Have to be on an hib visa. There is no rush - you will have six years on the
Hib visa - plenty of time in which to get the green card."
This was in reference to her note to me, as follows:
" I think i' ll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and
Opt. This makes almost two years. If we can start green card process now, do
You think that I would get it before I need hl. In every case, can' t we start
Green card before I get hl? Because I don' t want to waste these two years
Given the fact that green card process is a long process."
