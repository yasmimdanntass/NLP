Dr. Hunter' s discussion is entitled" lessons learned from recent global
Financial crises." since 1990, major banking and currency crises have
Occurred in many countries around the world - including mexico and latin
America in 1994, east asia in 1997 - 98, and russia and brazil in 1998,
Among others - with large costs both to the individual countries
Experiencing the crises and to other nations. As a result, considerable
