Subject: lng by rail
Vince,
I was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman
About, in the dabhol lng context. It occurred to me that one way to collect
On regas charges, and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the
Railways.
Some time back, I had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by
Train. Apparently, technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic
Containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded
From trucks to train bogies. I believe this maybe a way to earn some monies
With lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers.
It is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr. 45
Minutes from the dabhol plant. Trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the
Rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of
India. If we target end - consumers directly, we could easily sell at retail
Type prices, and build in a large margin, even if the volumes disposed are
Relatively smaller. (the alternative fuel for most of these establishments
Is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced, and mostly trucked along
Roads, increasing costs). The end aim is to keep income targets in india, so
That the analysts do not have a field day with the stock.
Hence keeping activity up in india, and showing that solutions exist, will
Keep stock price buoyed. We could explore this idea if it appeals!
Regards,
Sandeep.
