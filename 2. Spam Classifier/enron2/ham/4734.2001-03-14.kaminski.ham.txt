Subject: course invoice
Vince,

Hi, hope you are well.
?
I' m just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people
Attending the energy and weather course.? Our records show that it hasn' t
Been paid, which is good.? We will re - do the invoice and charge you only for
Alex and tom' s attendance since paulo didn' t show.? Is this ok with you?? By
The way, we only charged $250 a person for the weather course since it was
Suppose to be an exchange of information session, and enron weather paid for
The venue.
?
Nice to have finally met you in houston!
