Vince,
Paulo and I talked to mr. Zhang on the phone. He is currently with
Kock equity trading and formly a quant supporting power trading.
His power market experience could be valuable to us.
I would recommend to bring him for an on - site interview.
Since we get more demanding power projects, alex needs some help.
