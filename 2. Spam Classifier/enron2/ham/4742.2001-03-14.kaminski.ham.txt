Vince and jeff,
Who should we list as a judge? I could list myself to act as the point of
Contact and i' ll also give my comments on the plans, but I think enron' s
" judge" should be someone in the capacity of evaluating enron' s early stage
Ventures.
Please let me know as soon as possible.
Thanks!

Dear ms. Patrick,
?
Anne stamer asked me to contact you regarding? Enron providing a judge for
Phase iiI of the business plan competition.? Phase iiI judges are generally
Partner - level individuals at venture capital firms,? Managing directors from
Investment banks, or other senior individuals? Who have extensive experience
Assessing and working with early stage ventures.? A phase iiI judge will
Receive five business plans, with the entire judging process requiring 4 - 5
Hours during the weeks of april 2 and april 9.? I am attaching a document
That describes the competition and judging procedures for phase iiI in more
Detail.? We are looking to finalize the list of phase iiI judges by march
23, so if you could please forward either anne or I the name of the
Appropriate individual, we can contact them directly with more details.?
Please let me know if you have further questions and we appreciate your
Support of the competition.
?
Sincerely,
?
Andrew gaffney
