Subject: california update 3/16/01
? A source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram
Energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week. Through an
Intermediary, we were able to corroborate this information with a senior
Member of the ca iso board. Coram energy is a relatively small wind
Generator qf based in west vancouver, british columbia, though it also owns
Wind stations in california. Coram has 238 40 kw units.
? The source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the
Fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to
Be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature. It is unlikely
That blackouts would happen in april or may, meaning a long wait for the
Cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid.
? The filing will be against socal.
? In order to file an involuntary bankruptcy, coram would have to file along
With at least two other creditors owed $10, 000 or more. Sources report coram
Has two other creditors who will file with them (working on finding out who
They are).
? Sources also report that other qfs are" taking legal advice" on how to
Proceed in light of these developments.
