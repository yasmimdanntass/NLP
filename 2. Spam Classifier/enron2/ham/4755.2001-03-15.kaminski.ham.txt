HI david,
I would like to check with you just to be on the safe side. I left our last
Meeting with the impression that only naveen and I would be working together
On the raptors. However, I heard from naveen earlier today and he wanted to
Include thomas (mark, I presume) in the meeting as well. I would like to
Ensure if that is indeed your intention. Please advise. Thanks.
Rakesh
