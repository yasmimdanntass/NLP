Subject: departure
The research group is a unique and extraordinarily valuable organization for
Enron. The success of the group has led to widespread recognition of enron' s
Leadership in quantitative finance as it relates to the energy markets.
Therefore, it is with great mixed emotions that I announce my resignation as
I move on to the next phase of my career.
I have enjoyed getting to work with each of you and wish you continued
Success for the future.
Highest regards,
Kevin kindall
Ps: comments, question, and anecdotes will be addressed in thursday' s
Meeting.
Shirley will have my contact info.
