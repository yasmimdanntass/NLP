Subject: bill koures
Vince,
Alex and I did a phone interview with bill koures.
He works for williams and had a wall street background.
He is very qualified for the work we are doing here (stochastic modeling,
Curve building, option valuation, etc.)
He programs in c and matlab.
In terms of quantitative skills, bill is better than ren zhang (koch) i
Talked yesterday. The only down
Side alex and I can think of about mr. Koures is that we may not get him due
To a higher price tag.
