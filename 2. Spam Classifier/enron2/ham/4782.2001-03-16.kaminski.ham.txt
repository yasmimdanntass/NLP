Subject: trash bash event on saturday, march 31 st
Thanks for the interest so many of you have shown in trash bash. Several of
You are of the mistaken idea that trash bash is tomorrow. It is not until
Saturday, march 31, 2001. Registration will be in sam houston park and
Trash will be picked up along buffalo bayou from so. Shephard to the wortham
Center. The work areas will be divided into 8 to 10 sections. When you
Check in, you will be assigned to a work section. If you are going to work
At the registration desk, you need to be at sam houston park by 7: 30 am. If
You are going to pick - up trash, you need to be at sam houston park by 8: 00 am.
There will be a pre - registration desk set up in the lobby of the enron bldg.
Sometime during the week of march 26 th and I will let you know the exact
Dates when they are given to me. If you pre - register, you won' t have to
Stand in the long lines at sam houston park.
Thanks again for your interest and help.
