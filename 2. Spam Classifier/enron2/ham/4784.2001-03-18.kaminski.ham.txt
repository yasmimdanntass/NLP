Anita, the other day I called you to get jason sokolov' s cost center. Some
Of his eis expenses (market data, long distance) for jan and feb 2001 were
Charged to the enron corp. Rac cost center. In order for our accountants to
Reclass the expenses, we need your approval that the expenses can be moved.
If this is okay, just reply back and let me know.
See the attached files for the detail of the expenses to be moved for jan and
Feb.
Thanks for your help,
Kevin
