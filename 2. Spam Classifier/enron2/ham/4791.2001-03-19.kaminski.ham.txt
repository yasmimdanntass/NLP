Subject: meeting with vince
Dear shirley,
As you may know, I am taking the research over from steve (I have always
Thought that steve' s movement from the research is a big loss for all us).
Please, could you help us arrange the meeting with vince when he is here in
London.
Thank you very much for your future help.
