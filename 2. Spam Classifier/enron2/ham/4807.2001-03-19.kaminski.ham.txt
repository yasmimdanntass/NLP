Subject: re: credit rating contact?
Kim,
I spoke with bill bradford, vp in enron' s credit department, and he offered
To field your questions regarding credit. He will be in the office this
Week. You can call him at 713 - 853 - 3831.
Regarding nymex traders, what kind of trader are you interested in? Larry
GagliardI trades nymex crude products. Let me know if you need his number
Again, or if you think someone else would be more helpful.
Good luck
Ken

We are still interested in talking to someone in the risk assessment group
About credit rating systems.
Could you get us the name of the contact who trades directly with nymex?
