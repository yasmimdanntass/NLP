Subject: financial engineering invoice #2001 - m 608
Connie:
In response to your email to vince kaminskI of 3/19/01, the subject invoice
Was sent to our accounting dept. For payment on february 25, 2001. We
Did not need the spav maintenance, so we deducted $1, 600. 00. Did you
Receive a payment in the amount of $4100. 00 that could possibly have been
Payment for this invoice?
I have left a message for our accounting dept. To see exactly when the invoice
Was paid and the check number. As soon as I hear from them I will left you
Know.
