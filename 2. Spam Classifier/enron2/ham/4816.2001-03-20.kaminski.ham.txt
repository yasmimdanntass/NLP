Subject: joe carson
Greg,
Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on monday.
1. Joe carson. I was very positively impressed by joe carson.
Enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and
Experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent
Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old
Shoulders.
One negative is that he wants to work out of new york. The tradeoff is
Between
Maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks.
2. Tony mends. I think you, or louise, should explore the possibility of
Using the skills of tony mends.
Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very
Smart
And efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that
Relies
On processing huge volumes of information.
