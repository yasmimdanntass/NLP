Subject: dinner speaker - may 23
Shirley,
This is to follow up today' s conversation with anita. As mentioned paul
Kleindorfer invited vince to be our dinner speaker on thursday, may 24. On
Reflection given the strong line up for wednesday - fred kahn et al - we
Would very much like vince to be the speaker on wednesday. This will
Conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there
For the wednesday.
I gather that this change should be acceptable to vince.
We will show vince' s name as follows:
Wincety j. Kaminski
Managing director - research
Enron
Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.
We would like to go to press today. Failing that we can go to press
Tomorrow. We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any
Corrections or changes. If you would respond to all of us it would be
Appreciated.
