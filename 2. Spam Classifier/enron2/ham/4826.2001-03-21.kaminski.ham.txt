Hi. I have email access!! My contact info...
Phone number: (561) 625 7525
Fax: (561) 625 7519
Feel free to forward this info to other members of the group. I' m
Still in corporate housing, so no home address yet.
The only loose end that I can think of pertains to an issue that came
Up in the exit interview. Am I to be reimbursed for unused vacation?
Norma villereal said something about this, but i' m not certain about the
Details.
Stay in touch.
