Dr. Kaminski,
Sorry for the late response,
It took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it' s almost dont: -)
It turned out that from june to august
Will be best for me for work at enron
(say june. 4 to august. 4)
But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?
First:
Is my suggested working period is ok with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
During the period.
Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
Dealbench team from ross and suresh.
I' d like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:
> 1. Write a paper in layman' s terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> explanation how multI - variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price - only auctions (is this true?)
> how many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> what types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> opinions on lotting strategies
> trends in online private auctions
> 2. Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90 + you provided) and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site
> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)
> 4. Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)
Third:
There is an e - procurement forum at haas school of business,
In may 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor prof. Arie segev.
A person from wells fargo bank will talk about wells fargo' s role
In e - marketplace payment initiative,
Where enron broadband services is also one of key players
Along with citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
Enron broadband services, who' s related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from enron
To see enron' s perspective, in the forum.
Here is a link to news related to the initiative,
Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
There could be any opportunity to do a case study,
Regarding enron' s business.
He is interested in e - procurement and e - marketplaces.
Business model and system architecture...
Thanks for reading this long email.
I' ll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
To answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.
Warm regards,
Jinbaek
