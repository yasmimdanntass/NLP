What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers. They only know how
To stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society. If it were
Not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a
Chance.

Ian,
Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
When I talked to you the first time about our real options
Internal seminar.
The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
From another school, and there is some sensitivity regarding
The intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
Materials
Outside enron.
Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
Around this issue.
Vince
