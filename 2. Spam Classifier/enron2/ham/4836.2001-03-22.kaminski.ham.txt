Subject: help on cluster analysis
Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all of your help that the
Three of you each gave me concerning cluster analysis. Your help was
Invaluable. As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster
Analysis to define the commercial zones in ercot. I only had a few days in
Which to learn the fastclus procedure in sas and prepare graphical views of
The results.
Your assistance ensured that enron was seen as one of three market leaders
Who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market
Participants analysis. We were the only participant who had the ability to
Graphically display the results.
I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and
Results. I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.
I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results. The
Presentation has the best overview.
Best regards,
Lance
