Subject: referral
Mr. Kaminski,
I have attached a resume below I thought you might find of interest, it is
From a business school acquaintance of mine, denis suvorov. Denis is a
Highly intelligent ph. D. Candidate at my former school and is currently
Looking for opportunities within a research/modelling framework. He has
Significant academic experience working on asset pricing models and after
Speaking with pavel zadorozhny about his background and objectives, he
Recommended I forward a copy of his credentials to you.
I hope this is suitable and would be of interest to you.
Thanks,
Matthew frank
