Subject: team 3
Ken,
It seems that there may be an internet bias as well (more affluent
And educated households are on - line).
One solution: develop a control group. Arm - twist clerical
Employees of the school to fill out the questionnaire
And also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends and families.
