HI vince,
?
I sent the attached for enron' s approval to fiona grant, but haven' t heard
Back.? In the contract that we signed it states that we need to seek
Approval from enron if we want to use the company name.? Is there someone
Else we should direct these requests?
?
Hope you are well.

Advertising the book?? It will usually follow similar format.
