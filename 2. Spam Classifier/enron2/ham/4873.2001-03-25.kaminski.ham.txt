Vince,
I' m glad you liked it. My next" enron" task is to try and develop a better
Understanding of the way you describe the use of btu swaps to create a
Synthethic multI - fuel plant. I understand the basic concept but want to
Learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
Company' s decision to build a single vs multI - fuel generator. Do you have
Some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?
See ya in april (we' re going to learn to" rope" calves this year).
Your friend,
John
