Subject: hedging lng volumes
HI marc,
Dpc would like a swap to hedge its price expsoure on lng. We do understand
That there exists a basis risk between jcc (the lng spa index) and brent (the
Market index for the product) and will bear such risk. We also appreciate the
Fact that this is a financial product and irrespective of actual consumption,
We will still have to bear the burden (if any) of the swap.
Fuel - lng indexed to jcc (closely correlated to brent futures)
Period volumes (tbtu) volumes (mt) volumes (jcc bbls)
January 2002 to december 2002 33. 61 650, 000 9, 127, 049
January 2003 to december 2003 48. 63 940, 000 13, 207, 496
January 2004 to december 2004 48. 63 940, 000 13, 207, 496
Crude swap price: can we look at a' dirty' hedge and get a crude ($/ bbl) swap
Price. Like any other regular swap, this will be a monthly settle product.
The above conversions from mt to bbls are based on lng conversion factors.
(14. 04 bbls/mt).
We also would like to understand the requirements of the credit group to put
This hedge in place. Please indicate the process as well as the security
Mechanisms to provide adequate credit support for the swap.
Please call me (98210 38711) or rajesh (98201 88310) for any additional info.
Regards,
Anshuman
