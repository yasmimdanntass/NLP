Subject: school teaching
Hello vince,
I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, mrs. Shirley notified me
That you were out of the country. Look, I need another favor. My wife, whom
You met last summer, and I have been living in the woodlands about a month
Now. We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as
A speech pathologist or a k - 6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a
Teaching job in the houston independent school district. However, I would
Prefer that she taught locally, in the woodlands. I need to know if you know
Of anyone we can contact to get her in the woodlands school system. I would
Greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again. I am attaching her
Resume' for your perusal. Thanks a million vince!!!
Sincerely,
Datren williams
