Subject: re: implementing clustering and jumps for power
Frank,
Our var team has been looking at different ways to implement clustering and
Jumps for power prices simulation
In var.
I attached the suggestion we came up with and the results of clustering and
Jump parameters estimation.
Would you like to discuss this methodology? We need your input.
Please, let me know,
Thank you,
Tanya.
