Mike,
We have decided to go ahead with the purchase of a single license of imsl
Libraries (c/c + +) for pc. I believe that would be cnl 4. 0 forpc. Let me
Check the cost for the license before we finalize it as I have mislaid your
Previous e - mail about the cost. It is my recollection that it is less than
$1500. Please e - mail to confirm with the precise number so we can proceed
Wih that.
Thanks,
Rakesh

Rakesh,
As we discussed, the cnl 4. 0 pc libraries are not license managed. Version
5 will be. The pc version 4. 0 can be installed on a network drive and
Called from networked pcs. As expected, we would ask that enron honor the
License agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
Permitted
By the license. Version 5. 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
Node locked or floating.
With regard to unix licensing, the current version of cnl for unix is
License managed. It can be licensed as node locked or floating. If you
Install the libraries on a unix server as node locked, the number of
Simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
Capabilities of the machine. A floating unix license would be checked out
By the individual user to be executed on a local machine.
Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
In the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
Desired platforms. This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
Under support.
If you have any additional questions, please let me know. I look forward
To
Providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
Help you solve your problems and understand your data.
Best regards,
Mike bothwell
