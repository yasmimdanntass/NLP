Subject: thanks again
Vince:
I' m looking forward to getting your outline on the economic paradigm. I hope
That, among all the paper i' ve bombarded you with over the last few weeks, i
Have included a reprint of a fall 1998 jacf article entitled" how to use eva
In the oil and gas industry." if this is not among the things I have left you
With, i' d be happy to send you a copy.
The discussion of hydrocarbon reserve values is very much along the lines we
Have been discussing.
Best regards,
