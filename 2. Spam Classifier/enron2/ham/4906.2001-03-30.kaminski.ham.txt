Subject: good meeting
Mark:
I enjoyed our meeting last tuseday very much and I look forward to calling
You again in a week or so. I think your idea of having me present to several
Senior enron executives including koenig and, perhaps, jeff skilling is very
Good.
I discussed this a bit with vince kaminskI on thursday as well and he
Expressed a strong interest in attending the meeting as well.
Regards,
