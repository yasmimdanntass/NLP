Subject: technical corner
Vince,
Last monday, I sent the vp' s an e - mail asking for their help (from them, or
From one of the people working with them) in providing a technical corner
Article by today. To date, sandeep and mike have responded but cannot do one
For this coming week. I didn' t get a response from the other three. Do you
Have something that could be easily adapted for the monday issue?
And, any suggestions about how to motivate a vp would be appreciated. My
Usual approach is to ask politely, which usually gets a positive response. I
Know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work, but surely as
Much as our people like to publish their ideas, one person out of
Forty - some - odd would be able to do something in a week' s time, right?
As always, I appreciate your help. And, if you would care to share some
Advice on how I can do this in a better way, I will always listen and learn.
