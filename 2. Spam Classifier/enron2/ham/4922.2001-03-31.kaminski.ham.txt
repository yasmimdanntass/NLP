Vince,
Tanya and I feel that there is a need for a constrained optimization routine
For our var related research. Numerical recipes does not contain
Subroutines where equality and inequality contraints can be easily
Incorporated. Also, the number of arguments that can be handled is also
Limited.
Imsl provides a comprehensive library of more than 300 c/c + + statistical and
Mathematical analysis functions. We think that it would be of great value to
Our efforts and to the efforts of our research group. Presently the cost is
Aproximately around $1500 and mike bothwell (visual numerics rep) assures us
As the version is not license protected, we all can use it as long as
Simultaneous usage is within the license.
Please let me know if you should need further information.
Thanks,
Rakesh

Rakesh,
As we discussed, the cnl 4. 0 pc libraries are not license managed. Version
5 will be. The pc version 4. 0 can be installed on a network drive and
Called from networked pcs. As expected, we would ask that enron honor the
License agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted
By the license. Version 5. 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
Node locked or floating.
With regard to unix licensing, the current version of cnl for unix is
License managed. It can be licensed as node locked or floating. If you
Install the libraries on a unix server as node locked, the number of
Simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
Capabilities of the machine. A floating unix license would be checked out
By the individual user to be executed on a local machine.
Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
In the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
Desired platforms. This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
Under support.
If you have any additional questions, please let me know. I look forward to
Providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
Help you solve your problems and understand your data.

Mike bothwell
