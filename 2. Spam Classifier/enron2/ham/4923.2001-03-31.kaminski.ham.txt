Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.
By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus
This spring before school lets out?? If not, let' s definitely plan on
Scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit
Campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.
Sincerely,
