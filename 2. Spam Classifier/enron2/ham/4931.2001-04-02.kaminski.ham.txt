HI stinson,
A colleague of mine - professor nalin kulatilaka of boston university -

Broadband area.
Please see the forwarded emails for further information and available
Dates.

HI iris
I have two different hats to wear in talking to enron. One is as a
Financial economist. The other as the director of the newly formed" global
Mobility innovation initiative (gmii) - - this is the research project
Funded by lucent, involving bu, lbs, and insead, to study various aspects
Of the mobile internet (read 3 g).
On the former I am working with a couple of ph. D. Students in understanding
(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
Market maker. This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
Specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
The way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth. I
Think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the
Ground.
(b) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
Market. This is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that
Most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them
And realizing their value is another. All of the incomplete contracting,
Asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
Valuation models. But they are real in practice. My impression is enron' s
Real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
These problems by imposing a market disciplining.
(c) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
Credit etc. This is specially important when many of the real assets have
Options features and therefore, include non - linear risk profiles. The
Story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.
On the gmiI front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
You think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber. I am
Working with several people at lucent on this issue. I think it would be
Wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room.
I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues. Perhaps we can discuss
Some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having vince kaminskI in the
Room would be very important to me.
As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of april are horrible. April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.
Regards
Nalin
