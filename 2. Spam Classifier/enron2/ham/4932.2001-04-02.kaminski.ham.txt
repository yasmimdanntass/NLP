Kevin
My wife checked with our bank - it will take up to 10 days for the $2000
Check to clear.
I checked with enterprise (the car hire people) last night and the total bill
Will be about $1251 - I don' t have this much left on my credit card, help!
I am really sorry about the hassle this is causing you, but I need some way
For enron to pay directly for the car, that way I won' t need the $2000 check.
Many thanks for your help
Tony
