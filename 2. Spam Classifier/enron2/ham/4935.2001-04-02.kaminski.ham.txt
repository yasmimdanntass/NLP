Subject: temporary internet access for 5 rice students
Good morning:
The research group will have 5 rice students, who are working on an
Enron project for their doctorate, coming to enron for approximately
1 week. They will be sitting in a conference room located on the 19 th
Floor research area.
We need to get them internet access (to be applied to one computer), with
One logon id and password.
Will you please let me know what I need to do to get this accomplished?
They will be coming this thursday, april 5 th.
Thanks!
