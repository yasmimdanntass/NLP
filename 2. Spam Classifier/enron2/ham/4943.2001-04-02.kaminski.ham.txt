John,
The phone number for ken lay is (713) 853 - 6773.
My recommendation is to call mark palmer first and discuss the book
With him. His recommendation will open the door. I shall mention this to him
As well. Mark' s phone number is (713) 853 - 4738.

Subject: good morning/afternoon
Vince,
One of my colleagues here at baylor is writing a book about" the business
Of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders. Bob darden
Is his name and he' s a former journalist and nice guy. He would like to
Contact ken lay about being one of his interviews. Do you think this is
Possible? If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that bob might
Use to contact ken' s secretary about setting up an interview?
If this is in any way" not ok" please just say so.
See ya,
John
