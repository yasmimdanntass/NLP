Subject: earth day - trash bash
I hardly know what to say!!! What a great turnout from the research
Department. We had 15 including spouses and children who worked check - in
And picked up trash. Thanks so much. Everyone from community relations was
Blown away by the turnout we had from research. I heard very nice comments
About our effort and about the fact that vince came out and worked. Thanks
Again for all your support. I personally appreciated it and I know everyone
Else from enron that was involved in this event appreciated it because I got
So many comments about our participation. I don' t know what else to say but
That you are a great group. Anita
