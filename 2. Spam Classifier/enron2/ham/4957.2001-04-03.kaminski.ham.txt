Subject: re: pserc industrial advisory board meeting invitation
Vince,
I agree with alex on this issue.
As an alternative for sponsorship. The ut electrical engineering dept. Is
Interested in sponsorship for research activities such as the one I just
Completed or as martin performed when he was at ut (just thought that I would
Mention this as a possible alternative). Would you be interested in a
Presentation or a" brown bag lunch" on this subject?

Vince,
I think it is important to keep a good relationship with pserc, but as of now,
It is not worth two days of your time to attend the board meeting. Besides,
Since
We are not a sponsor yet, we have virtually no voice in the meeting and our
Presence
Sometimes is awkward. Again, even if we are one of the thirty or so sponsors,
Our
Voice is rather limited, for most of the other sponsors have different
Concerns from
Ours. One way to remedy this is to individually sponsor some research
Projects, via
Sumer intern or invited talks.
