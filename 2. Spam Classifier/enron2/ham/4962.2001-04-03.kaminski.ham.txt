Subject: financial mathematics course - urgent
HI vince,
In order to provide the marketing department with sufficient lead time for
Our financial mathematics course, the brochure will need to be printed by
The end of next week. I would like to confirm the bullets for your two
Sessions at the 2001 series of courses. If you feel that there is little
Need to update the points i' ll include the previous outlines. The one
Addition I would like to make is on the' practical example' point at the end
Of each session. If we could provide a line outlining what the example would
Be, this would add some important information to this event.
I will be in the office until wedesday afternoon and would very much like to
Talk with you about your views on this years' event. I will be out of the
Office on thursday and friday and will need to confirm my changes at the
Start of next week.
I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Best wishes,
Paul bristow
