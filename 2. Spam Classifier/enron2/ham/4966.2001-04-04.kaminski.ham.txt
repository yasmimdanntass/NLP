Subject: support on statistical modeling
Dear vince:
I was referred by rita hartfield of ebs. I am the director of marketing for
The digital content services team (david cox, frank bay, et. Al.). We are
Identifying and evaluating features and functions that will be a part of the
Next generation entertainment on demand (eod) product.
The e - mail i' ve excerpted below contains two links to a company that offers a
" preferencing" service that we know is quite popular and important to
Entertainment consumers. I have some questions abouts the statistics,
Sampling methodology, explained variance etc. Of the model that the
Stylelogic group employs.
Do you have a member of your team that could assist on this project?
Thanks for your help,
Randall hicks
