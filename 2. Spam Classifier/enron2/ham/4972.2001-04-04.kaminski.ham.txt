Subject: phone call today
Vince,
There are a few matters i' d like to discuss with you:
Clarification on who tony harrison reports to (I had understood it would be
The houston crude oil weather forecast team but I am not now sure)
To let you know that joe wants to recruit a strongly mathematical
Macroeconomist reporting to steve, and therefore that maureen will be
Returning to houston later this month
To talk about stinson coming over for a visit
