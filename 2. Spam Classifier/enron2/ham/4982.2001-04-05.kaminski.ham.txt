This may be of interest to you. I was contacted by steve lake from argonne
National laboratory who is interested in selling us some of their models and
Mapping software. Let me know if there is any interest.
Thanks,
Beth

Beth,
I enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible enron/argonne
National laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our divisions,
Decision information sciences has built state of the art tools for modeling
And simulating energy use. They have trained many country energy ministries
On the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy technology issues.
I' ve attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in
This area. Decision information sciences also has done much work in studying
Critical infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also
May be of interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of
Agent based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that
Are impossible to view with over approaches.
I will also include a copy of my correspondences with one of your e - business
Groups under separate transmission.
Regards,
Stephan lake
