Chris,
E hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that, given
Highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research group, with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
Group.
Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm, it makes sense
For research to charge his expenses
To global markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to
Different sub - units of gm.
Tony spent the last few weeks in houston training for his position in london
With mike roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.
Vince

Tony was hired to work for global markets. Think costs should be assigned
To vince or mark but if you
Believe those costs should be for my group let me know.

I now have tony on one of my rcs (research). I understand he will be doing
Weather forecasts for some or all of you, and that he has a desk allocated in
Global. I need to recharge his costs - can someone please advise the right
Cost centre.
Many thanks,
Tani
