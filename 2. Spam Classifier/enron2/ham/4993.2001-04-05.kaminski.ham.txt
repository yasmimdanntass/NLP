Subject: vince kaminskI expense reports
HI liz:
Vince has two expense reports pending for approval from greg whalley.
They are: london trip - 8, 051. 59
Philadelphia (wharton business school) - 2, 067. 47
Please have greg approve these as soon as possible.
The wharton school will be cross - charged to christie patrick' s cost center.
But for expediency in getting this paid it was submitted on our cost center.
Thanks!
Shirley
