Good to hear from you. Things are going pretty well hear, but busy with the
End of the semester coming up.
As for u of h, I guess there are several possibilities depending on what
Shane wants to do. The best researcher in their group by far, in my
Opinion, is bong - soo lee. But he does more general asset pricing stuff.
Minnesota econ phd, really smart. Their main derivatives guy is rabon
Rabinovich. He' s done some good work in the past but not very active in the
Last five or ten years. Or, you could go with ron singer or art warga
(art' s more respected and more active). These guys are more senior, more
General, and do more research than ramon - - I would guess that they tend to
Be the workhorses in terms of advising phd students at u of h.
In any case, please destroy this info as soon as you digest it. I would
Hate for my candidate assessments to ever get passed along to the good folks
At u of h.
