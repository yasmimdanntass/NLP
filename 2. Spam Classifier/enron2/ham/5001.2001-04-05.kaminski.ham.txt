Subject: tony hamilton/joe carson questions
Vince,
I just wanted to follow - up with you regarding the action items that were
Taken away from yesterday' s meeting with you, mike roberts, norma, and myself.
1) tony hamilton
As you know tony' s official start date was march 12, 2001, and he has yet to
Receive a paycheck. London' s pay cycles are different than ours however, and
They only get paid on the 20 th of each month. Tony did not receive a
Paycheck on march 20 th because all of his new hire information has to be put
Into sap (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to
Receive a check on the 20 th. Consequently, tony will not receive his first
Paycheck until april 20 th. If you would like for me to try and work with the
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please
Let me know.
2) joe carson
From what I am able to gather, gary hickerson did make joe carson an offer
That consisted of a one - year contract. However, gary is out of town until
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal. Would you like me
To contace joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for
Me to wait until gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.
I look forward to working with you.
Thanks,
Anne labbe'
