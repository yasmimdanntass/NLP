Go to http:// www. Winedt. Com /, select downloads, and download winedt 5 to your

On bottom of the same page (download), click on miktex' s home page,
Click on miktex 2. 0, and download all the highlighted zip files. You may also
Want to download miktex - 2. 0 - manual. Pdf.
You can then unzip all the files and follow the steps outlined in
Miktex - 2. 0 - manual. Pdf to
Install winedt and miktex. However, the procedure to" add miktex bin

This software is quite easy to use and very versatile. You can even include
Colored picture in your tex document.
