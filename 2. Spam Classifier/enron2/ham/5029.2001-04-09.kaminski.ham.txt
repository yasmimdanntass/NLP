Subject: new business
Dear vince,
A friend of mine, head of research and new projects in a major bank,
Wanted to get in touch with the energy industry to possibly develop
Working relationships. I said that enron was the right place to start
And" you" the right person to meet. In this order, he would come to
The power 2001 and I would introduce him to you.
Is this o. K with you?
Best regards
Helyette
