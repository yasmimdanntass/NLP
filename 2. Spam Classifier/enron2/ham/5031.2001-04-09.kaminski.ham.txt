Vince:
This is a candidate from stanford I mentioned to you about last friday. He is a student of my thesis advisor there. He seems to have solid math and statistics background (including stochastic calculus) and his thesis is on supply - chains. You mentioned about two possible positions: one in net works and another in freight trading.
Thanks,
Krishna.

Dr. PinnamanenI v. Krishnarao
Vice president, enron corporation
Dear dr. Krishnarao,
Professor veinott told me a little about the research going on at enron
From his conversation with you late last week. The work sounded very
Interesting to me. Professor veinott also told me that the research group
At enron may have some positions for which I might be qualified. I am
Writing to let you know that I would have great interest in exploring this
Potential opportunity with you. To that end I attach my resume together
With an abstract of my ph. D. Thesis under professor veinott as a word
Document. I might also add that I expect to finish my ph. D. In management
Science and engineering here by july 1, 2001.
Incidentally, my work has led me to study your own thesis in some detail
And I have been very impressed with it. It may be of some interest to you
That our work is related and seems to require a different generalization
Of karush' s additivity - preservation theorem than the lovely ones you
Develop.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Ningxiong xu
