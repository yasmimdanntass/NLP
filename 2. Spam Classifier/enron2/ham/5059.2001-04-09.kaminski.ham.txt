Martin,
Let me read it friday. We run our papers by our pr
Department to review for any potential conflict with the company line.
I shall fwd it to them.
I think you should submit it as an enron employee with a note
That it was developed when you were at ut.

Subject: publication submission question
My supervising professors from ut and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that is based on work done for my phd. All of the research was done while I was a grad student. I have a couple of questions regarding submission of this paper (to ieee transactions on power systems).
1. Should I submit it with my affiliation as the university of texas at austin or as enron (ena, corp, etc)?
2. What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?
A draft of the paper for your review is attached.
Thanks,
Martin
