Subject: working at home this afternoon
I will be working from my home this afternoon after 1: 30 pm. My extension will be forwarded to my home. If I happen to be away from the phone taking care of my mother, leave a message and I will return your call immediately. There is a generic message on my home phone," please leave message after tone", so don' t worry that you have the wrong number. You may reach me by email at adupont@ pdq. Net. In the next several days, I will be set up to dial in and you will be able to use my regualr enron email address. I will be at my desk most days, but until we have mother settled in the rehab facility there may be some days or afternoons that I will be working at home. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need meetings set up or any other thing that you would normally request of me. Thanks. Anita
