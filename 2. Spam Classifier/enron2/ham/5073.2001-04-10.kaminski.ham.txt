Subject: your lap top
Vince:
The it migration team called and said that they need an email from you
Stating that you do not want your lap top" ghost upped"? (not sure if this
Is the correct term). They said they were supposed to do this to all
Computers during the migration process, but since you requested that
They not do this, then they need an email from you with this request.
You need to send the email to: kacee downey/enron@ enronxgate
Thanks!
Shirley
