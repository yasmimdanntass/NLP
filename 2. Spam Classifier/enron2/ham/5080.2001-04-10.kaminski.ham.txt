Subject: outage pricing model revision: allowing for power price vs. Outage
Correlation
I have included provision for providing rank correlation between" jump
Occurrence in daily average power price" and" outage occurrence". The model
Will provide the same claim distribution as before when pricevsoutage
Correlation = 0 is used. Claim goes up as the correlation is increased. I
Have performed some sensitivity analysis and the results seem to make sense.
The new model workbook is" 40901. Xls" and corresponding
Dll is" outagepricingo 40901. Dll", both located in
O:\grm\research\outagerisk\subdirectory. The price vs. Outage rank
Correlation input will need to be provided in" main" spreadsheet. Please
Call me if you have any questions.
