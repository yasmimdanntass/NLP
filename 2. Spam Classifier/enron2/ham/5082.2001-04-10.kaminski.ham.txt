Annette...
We just wanted to drop you a quick line to thank you for the invitation to
The uk met presentation today! Tony and I are currently trying to get a
Grasp of what the traders here require in the way of weather information and
Are building a support structure for them. As such - we will need to have
Close ties with the uk met office as well as other data providers. The
Information presented today was very helpful.
We' d like to take a little time to sit down with you - and/or some of the
Other participants whose markets are weather driven. We' d like to get a feel
For what data is already streaming in - and then get an idea as to how we can
Utilize and supplement that data for the europe markets. We have a model
Created in houston to start from - but we want to make sure to tailor to the
Needs of the traders here.
Would you like to take some time to sit down and chat? Perhaps tony and i
Can take you and some others out to lunch - or for an afternoon coffee?
Thanks for your help...
