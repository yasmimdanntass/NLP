HI vince,
I may have missed something, however don' t believe I have received any
Communication recently from andy festow about this upcoming may 4 - 5 corp.
Fin. Conference. I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don' t know as
Of now.
I have andy penciled in as a participant on a" panel" that is discussing
Equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
Require little, if any, preparation time). Of course, I want andy to
Come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
Should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.
Dave.
