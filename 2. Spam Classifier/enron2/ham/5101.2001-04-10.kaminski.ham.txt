Subject: model effort in houston
Christian,
Our spring/fall window of" < nactivity" is rapidly eluding us...
We need to get our internal model operational without delay.
Along these lines, let' s go ahead and plan your visit to houston as soon as
Possible,
But by all means get you in at least 4 weeks before hurricane season.
That would mean the month of may looks good.
Please inform me what duties you could not perform from here to support the
Sydney office,
We' ll figure out how to keep that office whole.
(it' s working without a hitch to have steve bennett in london, but continuing
His houston duties)
If the first week in may (for the whole month) will work, please respond asap
And we' ll get housing arrangements finalized.
Looking forward to your visit,
- - - mike
