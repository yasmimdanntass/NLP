Stinson,
I am the new hr generalist for the research group because norma villarreal is
Moving to business analysis and reporting. Earlier this week, norma and i
Met with vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up
A list of sevil' s projects/accomplishments for last year and this year, so
That we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during
The normal prc time. At your earliest convenience, will you please email me
This list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so
That she can receive a check on april 16 th.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5 - 7809. I look
Forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at vince' s staff
Meeting.
Thanks,
Anne labbe'
