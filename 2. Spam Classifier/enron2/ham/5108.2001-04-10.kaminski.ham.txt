Dear ron,
My boss, enron' s chief international economist, is interested in talking with
Sais grads who might want to come to houston and do economics work. Same
Drill as last time, looking for someone whose done the quant track but with
Excellent writing skills. I think I sent you a job description a few months
Back.
Can you help identify some candidates, and send their resumes our way? Molly
Magee is our recruiting expert and she can help setup the interviews with
Maureen. Maureen is still in london on secondment but is available to
Interview people of the phone.
Thanks for your help.
