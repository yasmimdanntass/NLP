Jim,
Charm looks more like a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it
More a
Production tool.
We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities charm
Has)
In about two weeks, at request of rick jones who joined ees from hsb. Rick
Worked on a similar model at his old company and wanted to have a similar
Tool
For his projects with enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet
(hopefully) later
This week.
I would tell willis that the model requires more work before enron can
Consider it as commercial product.
Vince
