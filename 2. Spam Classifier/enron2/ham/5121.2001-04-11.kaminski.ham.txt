Subject: p + option valuation model
Mark,
After recently reviewing the booking of the p + options, it is my
Understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread
Option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are
Assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes (i. E. The price
Process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions
Extended to two commodities).
The payoff for a call option is:
Payoff = max (0, a ) b ) k).
Where:
A = nxwtI (delivery price for nymex)
B = posting price = (wtI swap) ) (posting basis)
K = posting bonus (fixed).
The only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options
Is that leg" b" of the spread is a combination of three prices, the two
Futures prices which make up the wtI swap for the given month, and the
Average posting basis during the delivery month. Combination of these
Prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg" b" and
The correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of
Prices and its correlation with the nxwtI price. I believe that this
Approach is more straightforward than the alternative, which would be to use
A three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and
Correlation matrices.
In summary, I believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of
These types of options, assuming that the inputs are set correctly.
