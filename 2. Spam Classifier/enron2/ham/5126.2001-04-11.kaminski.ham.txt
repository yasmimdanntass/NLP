Dear mr kaminski,
?
I am responsible for the programme of this year' s powerisk conference in
Paris. Helyette geman has informed me that she has contacted you concerning
The workshop and that you are happy to do it with her again this year -
Brilliant!
?
I would like to know if you are also interested in delivering a paper again.
The audience in previous years greatly appreciated your contribution, and i
Would me more than happy if you could join us again.
?
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are the (" technical")
Topics that are already covered:
?
Chris strickland: forward curve models with jumps for the pricing of exotic
Energy contracts
MultI - factor forward curve models for the valuation of energy contracts

Speaker panel, and which topic you would like to cover. I think that
Something along the lines of last year' s talk (state - of - the - art volatility
And correlation estimation techniques for multiple energy portfolios) would
Be brilliant again, but please feel free to chose something else that has
Not been covered yet.
