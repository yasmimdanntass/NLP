HI everyone,
I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some questions the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on enron' s aggregate credit risk?
7) there is one last point here. For most of the above points, the" improved" analysis could make the credit risk be higher.
