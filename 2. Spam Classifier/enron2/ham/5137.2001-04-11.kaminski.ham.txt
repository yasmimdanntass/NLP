Subject: jacob feedback
Vince,
Chonawee and tom halliburton had feedback about jacob to me.
Tom' s feedback is what he does for pros is actually too simple. Their
So - called
Trading system is actually a scheduling system.
My impression is that jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge
Of finance and derivatives is very limited.

I asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered
Correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good
Foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic
Skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his
Previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview
Time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.
He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his
Basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak
Background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the
Relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in
Annuity calculation.
In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak
Background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his
Advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to
Attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second - round
Interview if he will be solving a complex - optimization problem.
