Subject: jacob feedback
Vince,
Chonawee and tom halliburton had feedback about jacob to me.
Tom' s feedback is what he does for pros is actually too simple. Their so - called
Trading system is actually a scheduling system.
My impression is that jacob is good at selling himself, his knowledge
Of finance and derivatives is very limited.

I asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge. He answered correctly in the optimization question so I believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill. I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.
He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation.
In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second - round interview if he will be solving a complex - optimization problem.
