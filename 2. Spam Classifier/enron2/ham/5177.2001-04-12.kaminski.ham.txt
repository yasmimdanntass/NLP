Subject: marketpoint gas model
Dear mr. Braun:
As I mentioned, I have recently been reassigned here at enron. Although I am
Still in the enron transportation services group, I am no longer the most
Appropriate contact for consideration of the altos gas model. I would
Suggest you contact kim watson at 713 - 853 - 3098 or of course, vince kaminski,
Who will remain very much a part of the decision process.
Regards,
John goodpasture
