Bill,
We spent about an hour with rick explaining the rationale behind different
Solutions
And I think he has a better understanding of the models at this point.
I think he was asked by jeremy to look into it.

Rick/vince,
Should this not be a credit/research initiative while the business unit
Focuses on originating good economic transactions? Not to be complaining,
But shouldn' t ees be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste
Resources on a project we are already moving forward on? You can' t run a
Portfolio model, unless you have deals in a risk system! How complex do we
Want these models to be? Behavioral implications on credit default? They
Still don' t seem to understand.
Regards,
Bill
Mark - please attend. You may want to include martin to help ees understand
The complexity of their deals.

HI everyone,
I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some
Questions the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random number
Generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a problem
In this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effect
Of using different random number generators on enron , s aggregate credit risk?
7) there is one last point here. For most of the above points, the" improved"
Analysis could make the credit risk be higher.
