Hi, dr. Kaminski:
I am zhendong, the student of dr. Deng. I think dr. Deng has sent my
Resume to you. I am very happy to have an opportunity to work with you
This summer.
I am a student in both ms qcf and ph. D eda programs in georgia tech
Now. I plan to find a job in industry instead of academic after my
Graduation. So I intend to do internship during the process of prusuing my
Degree to acquire some experience for my future career.
I hope to start on 5/14/2001 and end on 8/17/2001.
Thanks a lot.
