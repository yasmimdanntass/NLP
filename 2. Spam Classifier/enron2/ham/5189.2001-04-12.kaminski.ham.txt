Vince,
Jacob has good background in or and can start working on
Pipeline problems right away, if we need someone.
Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times
He exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would
Start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit.
(what he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.)
He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline
Projects.
I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives
And finance.
Best,
Alex
