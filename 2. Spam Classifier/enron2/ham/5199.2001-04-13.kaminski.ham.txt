Subject: option visualization
Vince and stinson,
I did some reserach on the option visualization. Here is one of the findings.
Check this web site, the image looks impressive:
This is done through a free software livegraphics 3 d and mathematica.
Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is good
Enough for our purpose.

What is livegraphics 3 d?
Livegraphics 3 d is a non - commercial java 1. 1 applet to display and
Rotate three - dimensional graphics produced by mathematica in
Html pages. It may be used without charge for any
Non - commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
And numeric mathematics by wolfram research, inc.. Wolfram
Research is also responsible for licensing livegraphics 3 d for
Commercial purposes.
Livegraphics 3 d enables all mathematica users to put almost any
Three - dimensional graphics computed by mathematica directly onto
A html page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
Java 1. 1 (e. G. Communicator 4. 0 or internet explorer 4. 0 or higher)
Can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
Software.
Additionally livegraphics 3 d is able to show animations, calculate
Stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
Backgrounds. %
