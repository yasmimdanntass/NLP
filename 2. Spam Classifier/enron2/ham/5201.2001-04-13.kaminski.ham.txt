Dear vince
Thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on may 1.
Kemm farney the head of wefa' s electric power services will be travelling
With me this time. I expect there may be other enron colleagues that may
Care to join us for lunch so don' t hesitate to invite as you see fit. For
Reservations purposes, perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers.
Kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook
To a larger group at 11: 00, if this would be of interest.
As you know, these types of presentations are part of all your wefa energy
Retainer package. I will also plan to update you with respect to our current
MultI client study schedule for the remainder of the year.
Regards, peter
