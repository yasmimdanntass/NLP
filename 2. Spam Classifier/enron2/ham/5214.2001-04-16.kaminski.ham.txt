HI stinson,
?
Thanks for meeting with us on thursday.? We enjoyed
Talking with you.
?
As per our discussion, I have attached the course
Outline of java for managers along with this email.
After our conversation with you we think this course
May be a little bit heavy for your group.? But we can definetly
Take it down to concepts level and make it appropriate for
Our audience.? Please review and let me know, if this
Course would be of value to you.? This is a 3 day course
And costs $11, 000 (maximum of 15 students).
?
Regards,
?
