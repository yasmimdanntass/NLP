Subject: 1/2 day seminar: the new texas electric market
Fyi,
I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at ut.
Bill hogan, as well as speakers from the iso and puc are scheduled to speak.
I plan to attend. If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for
$145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person. Ross
Baldick, one of martin lin' s and my advisor is the moderator. It may prove
Both interesting and contentious will hogan being there.
