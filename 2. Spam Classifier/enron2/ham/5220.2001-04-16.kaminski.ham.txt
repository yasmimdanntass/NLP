Dear mr. Ray,
I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
The power systems engineering research center' s
Upcoming industrial advisory board meeting in oak brook.
Our work load does not leave us much time to get involved
With pserc at this moment. We would very much like to stay
In touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.
