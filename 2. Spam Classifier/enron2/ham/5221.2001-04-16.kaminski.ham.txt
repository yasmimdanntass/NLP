Subject: reschedule meeting for duffie report
HI shirley,
This email is in reference to your vmail regarding my rescheduling my
Meeting on tomorrow at 2 pm with vince. That is fine with me because the
Credit guys (craig chaney and jeff kinneman) have had a change in strategy.
They have asked us to take some time to evaluate moody' s riskcalc software.
Therefore I have had to put the duffie project on hold for the last few
Days. However I am about two thirds through the duffie documents and will
Resume studying them as soon as I get through the lengthy riskcalc documents.
Let me know if he still wants to meet later in the week
Thanks,
Iris.
