Subject: godbole report
Vince/stinson,
This is a summary fo the report submitted by the godbole committee appointed
By the state government to review the dabhol project.
The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff. A lot of what they
Mention is something we won' t agree to. However, to me it seems apparent
That this can be worked out.
Regards,
Sandeep.
