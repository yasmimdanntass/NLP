Subject: prc feedback forms
Mr. Kaminski:
I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to
Discuss the draft prc 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to
Ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate
For your employee population. The generic forms that were presented at the
Prc committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and
To some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely
Appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical
Areas. I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time
Permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the
Organization.
One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting
Evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance,
Another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to
The list of those already developed (second attachment below). I would
Welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about
This.
Many thanks,
Gina corteselli
