Subject: prc feedback forms
Mr. Kaminski:
I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to discuss the draft prc 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate for your employee population. The generic forms that were presented at the prc committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical areas. I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the organization.
One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to the list of those already developed (second attachment below). I would welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about this.
Many thanks,
Gina corteselli
