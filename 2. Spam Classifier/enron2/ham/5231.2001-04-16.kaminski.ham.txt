Subject: re: stanford mba - interview
HI vince,
Unfortunately, I have not heard from him. He also forwarded his resume to mauricio mora, who asked if we could interview him. When I asked celeste about it back then she decided against it. If you need some help tracking him down, let me know.
Thanks,
Althea

Althea,
I was trying to get in touch with this guy.
Did he contact you by any chance? He missed
The interviews on the campus.
Vince

Dear vincent,
As I told you on the phone on friday, I am very interested in a summer
Internship at enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
Career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
Derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.
I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and i
Hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
Final exams from march 19 - 22, but would be most willing to travel to houston
For interviews any time from friday march 23 rd onwards. I hope to hear from
You soon.
Best regards,
Juan seade
