Subject: re: weather and energy price data
Dear dr. Kaminski:
Thank you very much for the natural gas information. The electricity price
Is also definitely of great help if it can be available.
Could you kindly please let me know the contact information for ft or
Megawatt daily? I will contact them asap to get their permission for the
Access of the price data.
Thank you very much and have a great day!
Mulong
