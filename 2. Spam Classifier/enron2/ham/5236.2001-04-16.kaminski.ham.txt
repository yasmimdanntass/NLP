Subject: weather and energy price data
Dear dr. Kaminski:
I am a phd candidate under the supervision of drs. Richard macminn and
Patrick brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
The weather derivatives and credit derivatives.
Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
The price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?
The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
Significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
Please offer me some energy price data during that time period?
Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!
Mulong
