Subject: karthik rajan
I spoke with karthik this morning about our offer, and answered some
Additional questions that he had. He has accepted our offer, but with one
Additional request. He would now like for us to ship his car. I asked him
Why he couldn' t drive it down here, and he said that it was too old. I am
Going to check with relocation for an approximate cost and will get back to
You....
Thanks,
Molly
