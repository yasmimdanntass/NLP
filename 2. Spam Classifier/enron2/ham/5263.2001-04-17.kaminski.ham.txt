Get an invite?

Energy derivatives class at 11: 30.

HI shirley,
Thanks for corresponding with carol during my absence, and confirming our
Meeting with vince kaminskI at 1: 30 on may 4 th. I have a question about
The logistics. I believe dr. KaminskI has received an invitation to an
Event in houston: new stanford president john hennessy is visiting a number
Of cities on a" welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
Luncheon in houston on may 4 th. If dr. KaminskI wants to attend the
Hennessy welcome tour luncheon, donna lawrence and I could meet with him at
1: 30 somewhere in the hotel. If he' s not attending the presidential event,
Please let me know where you are located, and we' ll plan travel time
Accordingly.
Regards,
Susan
