Subject: times 2 filing units
Pat:
Recently, I talked with you about ordering another filing unit. It turns out
That we need 2 more filing units. Please order them the same size as the
Floor to ceiling cabinet we have. Have the inside of the cabinets configured
As follows:
1 cabinet should have 5 shelves
1 cabinet should have 6 shelves
When interstore was here today reconfiguing 2 of our existing cabinets, they
Removed 8 shelves that they are going to use on these new units.
Please price these 2 new units and charge them to co. #0413, rc #107043.
Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date. Also, let me know
If you need anything else. Thanks. Anita
