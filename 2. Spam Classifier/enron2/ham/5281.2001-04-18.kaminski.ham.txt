HI iris
We started off with about 105 companies, which were enron europe' s uk power
And gas desk counterparties. I' m not sure where you got the figure of 500
From - maybe this is the entire enron europe counterparty list, which
Constitutes the next major effort for end - july.
From this list of 104, only the 72 in the spreadsheet had information in
Amadeus. The other firms had no information available, most likely because
They were too new.

HI again,
Thanks for the financial data on enron' s european counterparties.
It is my understanding that you started out with a list of 500 such
Counterparties. However, your spreadsheet only contains information for 72
Of these european counterparties.
Will you please tell me the logic behind the elimination of the 400 + other
Counterparties?
Thanks so much,
Iris

HI iris
The inputs and outputs generated by riskcalc can be seen in the attached file:
>
We only looked at the 5 - yr pd.
Inputs are in columns a - u. These are the inputs generated by amadeus. You can
Run these inputs through the riskcalc model over the web
(http:// www. Moodysqra. Com/privfirm) using the login: dupred, password:
Detective. This is our trial licence which lasts for about 2 more weeks (mike
Mumford will have more details about the current licence)
Tomas valnek was getting the data from the amadeus database, so i' ll leave it
To him to determine if houston access is possible. In the meantime you can
Use the dataset attached for testing purposes.

HI ben,
How are you? Today we had a meeting with craig chaney and jeff kinneman to
Discuss the private firm model.
They requested that I spend some time carefully analyzing the moody' s
Riskcalc model. I noticed that you also have been looking at riskcalc - as
Indicated in your paper entitled" pricing parent companies and their
Subsidiaries: model description and data requirements"
Other than the example discussed in your paper, did generate any other test
Statistics, scores, etc.
Also, you stated that you used amadeus database. We are in the process of
Trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while.
In the mean time, may we have access to the amadeus database or some sample
Dataset?
Thanks so much,
Iris
