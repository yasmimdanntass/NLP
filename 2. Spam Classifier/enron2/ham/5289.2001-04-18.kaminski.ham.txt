Dear lance,
Thank you very much for all of your help through this process.
At present, I am really tied up with mock market activities in austin
Energy. It would be inappropriate for me to leave at this time since the
Whole project will be jeopardized. Therefore, I decided not coming to
Houston for an interview. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this
May cause you.
I do appreciate what you did and hope we can keep in touch in the future.
Thank you again for your help and wish you best.
Sincerely,
Weijun ji
