Andy,
Sounds good. One comment: vasant is swamped with work coordinating
Several high profile projects.
Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
Internally from other members of the group: this contribution
May not be directly visible but it will be still very important.
We appreciate your hands - on involvement. It' s always the most
Important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent interaction
With the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.
Vince

Subject: trading algorithms
Guys,
Here is what I took away from our meeting:
1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of enrononline data.
2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of enrononline data
3). Research will a contribute a resource to the trading algorithm effort, presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be vasant but I am flexible. The trading algorithm group will be run by the enrononline team with its product reviewed by research. It is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track.
If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can discuss.
Thanks,
Andy
