Iris/amitava,
I may have already said this, but we' ve had so many e - mails and telephone
Calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this
Much out to you. Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the
Riskcalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they' ll tell)
And the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model
May have. Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model
Extends to other countries. I know from a previous conversation with lea
Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off north american
Names but they suspect it might extend to other countries. Conversely, i
Know they are working efforts within moody' s risk management services to
Develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions. One
They mentioned was australia and also within western europe. Data, as
Always, was the issue. See if the quants have any perspective on their
Success/plan in that area.
Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward
Pushing off this private model initiative and i' m very confident we' ll be
Able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either d & b and/or experian data.
Cheers,
Scott

Hi,
Two riskcalc sales people made a presentation this week about their product.
They stated that they could set up a meeting with their quants and our
People to discuss the model input and what happens if we have less than 17
Inputs.
Regards,
Iris

Ooops... Part ii.
I just threw out 12 as a number for something we might develop... It' s really
Not based on anything. We know 17 will work for pre - packaged programs. We
Also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17...
I assume we would pursue another model (internal or external) to provide
Probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer
Inputs.

Iris,
Thanks.
After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.
Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... We have duns
Cross - references on about 70 of active names (13 k out of 18. 5 k). We could
Greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major
Data associated with these specific duns numbers.
Pro - data gets in on names we know we want to review asap, but without
Resolution on which specific fields are most useful. We also get to test for
Completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... How many have only 12 of
Which fields, etc.).
Con - costs could be significantly higher... Buying info we don' t know we
Need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn' t seem best answer). We
Would end up buying additional info later... Overhead costs and piecemeal
Buying will increase costs. It development time would be greatly
Increased... Multiple file formats... Developing to unknown maximum size,
Etc.... Redoing when more data is purchased.
Any thoughts.
Mike
