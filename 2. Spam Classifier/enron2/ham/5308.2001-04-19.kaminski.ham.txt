Subject: re: london status report - research weather
HI mike,
Please find a list of our current daily products and services, together with
Identified research projects (to - date) for european weather research - this
Has been forwarded to tanI nath to aid her recommendations for a 2 nd met. For
London.
1) this week:
* a meeting with james willis (agriculture) has been arranged for monday
Afternoon to discuss weather input for softs.
* following suggestion from tani, meeting has been pencilled in with pierre
Aury (coal trading) to discuss weather input.
* at present we are providing kristian lande (continental power) with daily
Precipitation outlook for spain - he is working towards getting a daily
Weather breifing for power set up.
* a meeting with alex mcleish (global products) has been pencilled in
Following his return from houston to discuss the way forward in building a
Forecast model for crude apI based on hdds on either side of the atlantic.
* we have made progress in getting additional information on european ports
Following meeting with scott moncrieff and sylvie mostura (shipping and
Transportation) - we now get forwarded daily reports for some baltic, black
Sea, scandanavian, italian and indian ports, which include various degrees of
Weather information.
* we now supply north sea conditions and forecasts as a part of the 8 am uk
Gas briefing.
* we' ve added a midday" update" for uk gas traders if/when mrf ensembles
Warrent changes or clarification.
* following extremely useful meeting with tanI nath, it is now clear that need
For 2 nd meteorologist will have to be cleared with her superiors here in
London before moving forward.
2) still to follow up
* get meeting with chris mahoney to determine if we can provide any
Additional support (e. G. Daily briefing) for crude and products.
* follow up on a potential morning briefing for continental power.
* get meeting arranged with david anderson at ecmwf to discuss data products
And services they provide.
* continue to investigate model grib data to produce a" confidence interval"
For model output.
* meet with ross mcyntire to determine needs from weather drivatives
* develop a standard hydro product (daily updates) for continental power
(spain specifically)
* develop forecast verification scheme and internal forecasting tools
* avistar recorded europe briefings
3) challenges:
* still appears to be some confusion over whether we are moving desks this
Afternoon or not!
* karin ahamer (the team assistant here) is going to verify later exactly
Which pcs we will be using from monday next week (some of the loaner pcs we
Are currently using contain important software left over from their previous
Users).
* our time in assembling reports is becoming more efficient on a daily
Basis. However as our product load increases this may become a factor over
Next few weeks.
