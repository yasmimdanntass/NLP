Hello karin,
I noticed that tony is taken care of, but what about stephen.
Tony and stephen are a team, they work very closely together.
Stephen also needs to be aware of what is taking place as well.
If there is a problem with cost centers please contact me, but
Please try and have both guys set up for monday morning.
Thanks so much.
Kevin moore
By the way have the avistar set - up been completed.......
Please inform...

HI karin,
I just wanted to check the status of our change in equipment for start of
Business monday. I' ve been told that tony and I will be using loaner pc' s.
The folks in it are asking me where that loaner pc is so they can install all
Of the software that I need. Slava has told me that you are the point of
Contact. I just wanted to check with you to see if you need any additional
Information from me - or if I can be of help in any way. Thanks!!
