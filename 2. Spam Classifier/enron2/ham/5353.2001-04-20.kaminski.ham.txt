Enron global lng
Enron global lng is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale lng market. The rising prices of natural gas in the united states and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for lng in the u. S. And around the globe. Lng has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the u. S. Energy picture has been limited. An lng market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world' s growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels. Enron global lng sees great opportunity for enron' s wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.
