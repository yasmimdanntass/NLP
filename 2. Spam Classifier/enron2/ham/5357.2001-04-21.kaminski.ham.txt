Subject: re: enron credit model docs for the comparative model study - to be
Sent to professor duffie@ stanford
HI ben,
I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative
Model study to be sent to professor duffie at stanford.
These documents are all listed below. Please let me know if I have omitted
Any (however, don' t get the impression that I am begging for more papers to
Read).
Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for professor duffie.
Thanks,
Iris
