Car rental options for enron travelers
Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:
National car rental (primary) and alamo rent - a - car (secondary).
The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron' s total
Car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing
Provisions (i. E. Insurance).
National car rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value
Proposition, has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first
Choice for enron travelers' needs.
Alamo rent - a - car, a sister company to national, has been awarded a contract
Reflecting a secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and
Low cost solutions. Alamo is recommended as an alternative to national,
Where available.
When you rent a vehicle in the united states, (including puerto rico) or
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate
Selected:
1. L/dw (loss/damage waiver) - this is what is called comprehensive or
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for
Any damage to it.
2. Liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.
For both national and alamo, the coverage is $100, 000 per person, $300, 000
Per occurrence and $50, 000 for property damage.

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron' s
Preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in
National' s and alamo' s preferred traveler programs. National' s emerald club
Membership and alamo' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the
Transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid
Return. The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron
Travelers. Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron
American express t & e cardholders. You may also find an enrollment form on
