Subject: eol stuff
Vince -
I spoke with tom, and I completely agree and would like to hand all this eol
Stuff over to you.
We need a sun server to take over the task. As it happens martin lin has one
In his office he' s not using and up to the task. His box could serve sas to
Enron, as well as handle listening in on the eol feedds and maintaining its
Database.
Martin' s box technically belongs to ebs, but I think they are downsizing and
Wouldn' t mind giving it up.
In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over
The data and any work you do with it. I needn' t be involved, and you can know
Your work is completely confidential.
I' ll make sas and the eol software available, as well as the necessary ram
The server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some sysadmin resources
To finish the job. There is a fine unix guy named ben thompson who will
Support you, i' m sure.
Task:
1) upgrade ram on martin' s server
2) install newest solaris os on server
3) install tibco and gnu software on server
4) install sas on server
