Subject: petrochem desk
I had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to
Curve building for petrochemicals. As it turns out, christian left rac in
April and joined the petrochem desk as a trader. Previous efforts at
Construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or
Swags. Unfortunately, the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of
The blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof. When asked
About the fundamentals group, christian indicated that they' d only been
Around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building. John
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.
From a timing perspective, I told christian that it would probably take at
Least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to
Understand the key market drivers/fundamentals. As was suggested yesterday
During our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex
Component (e. G., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point - - we could
Then potentially strengthen/augment this relationship with other key factors
(e. G., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.
