All:
This is the rough schedule we came up with at today' s video conference:
Submit rfp to d & b, experian, and amadeus 2 days 25 apr mumford
Receive back rfps 1. 5 weeks 4 may mumford
Complete evaluation, selection & authorization 1 week 11 may mumford/mack

Data to iris & amitava 3 weeks 15 june mumford

* integration of model and data feeds into cts 6 weeks 30 august kirkpatrick
Prior to integration into cts any prices would have to be manually uploaded
Into cts via spreadsheet.
The rfp will include a request for a smaller data calibration set that we may
Select to purchase immediately.
We can revisit this schedule at our wednesday video conference.
