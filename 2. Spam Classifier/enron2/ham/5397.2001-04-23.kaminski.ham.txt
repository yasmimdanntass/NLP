HI vince,
This resume looks quite good. We may wish to talk to him on the phone. However, now that david hoog has hired his own actuarial guys (alex tartakowskI and larry markus) from ace, I am not sure if they require support on the actuarial side. With don black (of global risk markets) leaving enron, I think the effort to develop power products for the insurance markets is pretty much nonexistent, except for david hoog' s product. The resume still looks interesting, though.

Dear sir/madam,
I am a student in a master' s programme in mathematical finance due to graduate in august. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative capacity in the
Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume in the hope that I might be considered for any available position in your risk
Management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.
I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.
Yours sincerely,
Ian mccracken
