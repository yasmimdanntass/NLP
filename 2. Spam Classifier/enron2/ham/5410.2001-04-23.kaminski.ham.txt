Subject: another stanford acceptance
Stanford team,
We have received yet another acceptance - noah jacobs has accepted our offer
As a summer associate. We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers. I have sent
Paul kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking
In on him next week. Also eric cope, a stanford student that vince
Kaminski' s group had interviewed here in houston for a summer associate
Position has also accepted. All in all our stanford numbers are looking
Great!
Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!
Althea
