Frank,
Regarding simulating power prices in var we might discuss the following items
And show some results:
1. Clustering for power:
- clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
- geographical clustering;
- flexibility in choosing" core curves" (based on position size);
2. Jump - diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
- parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)
- working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios;
3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters.
4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series).
5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.
Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.
Regards,
Tanya
