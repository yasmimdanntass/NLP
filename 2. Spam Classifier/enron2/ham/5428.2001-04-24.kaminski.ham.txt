Jim,
Thanks for the feed - back. To assist in the further development of the
Product, are there any specific areas your group would like to see improved
? Based on comments made during our meeting, it sounded like your main
Concern was whether or not charm would have the capacity to cover the very
Different and complex risk areas that your company is involved in. Would
You mind if someone from our charm group called you or mr. KaminskI for
Some specific comments?
Regards,
Bertil

Bertil, I again wish to thank you for the presentation on the charm
Product. The response from the group is that the model requires more work
Before enron could consider it as a commercial product. Please keep me
Advised as I assume that you will continue to develop the model.
