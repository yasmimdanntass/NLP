It' s ok to delay the materials for duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not
Going to complain.

HI amitava,
We' ve been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information
On our modelling process we' ll provide to darryl duffie. We think it would
Be extremely valuable for iris to come out to london for a couple weeks to
Gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly
Employed. I think this would greatly enhance the" product" we' ll send to
Duffie as well as giving iris a firm view of enron credit. In addition, she
Could also explore some of the data sources such as amadeus and others that
Might be helpful in private firm modelling. If we' re extremely
Efficient/lucky in receiving data from d & b or experian, she might be able to
Begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.
I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30
Apr perhaps. Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources,
It probably makes sense to send her back to houston to work on calibration
Sets with a likely return visit to london as required.
Please let me know your thoughts.
Cheers,
Scott
