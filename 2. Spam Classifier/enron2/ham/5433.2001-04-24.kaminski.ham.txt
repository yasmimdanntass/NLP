HI iris
I would not include paper 8, as paper 7 supersedes it. Also how much
Rewriting of these papers do you envisage? Some of them are not up - to - date,
Or were written poorly and under time - pressure, so what do you envisage
Eventually sending to duffie?
Thanks
Ben

HI ben,
I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative
Model study to be sent to professor duffie at stanford.
These documents are all listed below. Please let me know if I have omitted
Any (however, don' t get the impression that I am begging for more papers to
Read).
Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for professor duffie.
Thanks,
Iris
