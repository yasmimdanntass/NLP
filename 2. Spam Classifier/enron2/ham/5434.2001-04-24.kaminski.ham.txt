It' s ok to delay the materials for duffie. He is very busy anyway and is not going to complain.

HI amitava,
We' ve been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we' ll provide to darryl duffie. We think it would be extremely valuable for iris to come out to london for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed. I think this would greatly enhance the" product" we' ll send to duffie as well as giving iris a firm view of enron credit. In addition, she could also explore some of the data sources such as amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling. If we' re extremely efficient/lucky in receiving data from d & b or experian, she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts.
I would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 apr perhaps. Depending on the progress with the private firm data sources, it probably makes sense to send her back to houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to london as required.
Please let me know your thoughts.
Cheers,
Scott
