If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, given the number of us going. Vasant has offered to drive. Dependiing on driving speed and traffic, leaving houston by 9: 30 am should give sufficient time to make the lpm class, including some time for lunch.
Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate plans or suggestions.
Thanks,
Martin
