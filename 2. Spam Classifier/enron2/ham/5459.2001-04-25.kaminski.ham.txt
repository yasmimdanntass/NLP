Subject: interview - credit derivatives

?????? Dear vince:
?
?????? Thank you for the invitation yesterday. It was a pleasure to meet
You all and learn more about the group, it' s structure and to some extent
What you are involved in. Please extend my thanks to all of them.
?
?????? I am particularly interested in the credit swap trading platform
That enron has recently started. Such a platform will provide unique
Visibility into the credit markets. As you suggested I tried to learn more
About this from tanya.? I would like to learn more and if possible meet other
People more directly linked to the effort.
?
?????? Just simple instruments like credit swaps will require serious
Modelling capability for the pricing and the hedging of these apparently
Simple intruments. The market visibility I mention above can be explored
Through credit derivatives trading successfully if enron possesses superior
(vis a vis morgan stanley, salomon smith barney, chase manhatan,
Etc.)? Modelling technology in credit derivatives. I can and would like
To? Consider the possibility of doing this for enron. I would like to help
Develop and participate in putting together that business.
?
?????? As I mentioned to you I have done some work in credit derivatives
And am deeply familiar with virtually all the work of the principal
Academics in credit derivatives namely: duffie, lando, tuffano, duffee, das,
Lelland, etc. I have read carefully most of their work (published as well as
Working papers) on the subject to date.
?
?????? I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?????? Best regards
?
