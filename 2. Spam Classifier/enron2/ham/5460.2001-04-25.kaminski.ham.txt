Molly,
We can pay for the plane ticket.
We have to make sure that we shall extend the same
Treatment to other summer interns to avoid
Bad feelings.

We received some correspondence this morning from jinbaek in which he says he
Plans to start on june 4, 2001. Since we are trying to offer a package
Comparable to that of an associate in the program, I assume we will also pay
For his plane ticket here??? Just wanted to check before I contacted
Him...., so i' ll wait to hear from you.
Thanks,
Molly
