Subject: potential prospect
Hey vince,
Given that the eastern finance conference is already taking place, I think
It is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
Table discussion. However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially
Having been on such a round table discussion.
I' ve been teaching a" real options" course that has the students performing
Monte carlo analysis, black - scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along
With a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing. A few of your
New hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course.
However, I have a student who will be finishing his mba next spring that is
Particularly good. He is genuinely interested and curious about option
Pricing, trading, and hedging with excel/vba skills. In fact, he usually
Figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.
This is not to say that some of my other students aren' t very talented
Themselves, but that this person really stands out. Do you think you
And/or enron would be interested in such a person? If so, what do you
Recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?
His intention is to finish the mba, but I do not know if this would
Preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now. His name is
George moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
Potential employee. I am making an exception in this case because he is a
Particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.
Otherwise, I hope this e - mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
Much.
Tom
