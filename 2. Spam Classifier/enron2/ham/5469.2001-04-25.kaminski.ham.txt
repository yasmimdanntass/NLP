Subject: re: one last reminder and then I will be quiet
E - mail is perfect. It allows me to just dump your grades directly into our
Database. I do then sign a hard copy (indicating that I am signing in
Proxy for you) to hand over to the registrar. If you prefer, you could fax
The information as well (713 - 348 - 5251). Thank you for your help! - pam
