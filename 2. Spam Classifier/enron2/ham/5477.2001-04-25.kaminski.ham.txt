Subject: harvard - - nyu itinerary
Hi!
Attached please find the itinerary for the harvard - - - nyu trip; please
Disregard any parts of the trip that don' t apply to you.
If I have not already done so, i' ll try this morning to get you a copy of the
Enron online case being taught at harvard tomorrow (thursday). Otherwise,
I' ll give it to you on the plane - - it' s fewer than 15 pages, so it' s a quick
Read.
Please call me if you have any questions (3 - 6117). Otherwise, i' ll see you
At the corporate hangar at 6 pm.
(for anyone unfamiliar with the location of the corporate hangar, I believe
You can get a map/address/directions from the enron aviation department.)
Thanks!
