Sevil: in order that we may proceed with your request for permanent residency, our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process the hib visa, prior to the permanent residency application.
Therefore, I am attaching an hib visa questionnaire that I would like you to complete and return to me, together with copies of all of the documents listed at the bottom of the form.
Please bring these to me in 3 ac 2026 a.
Please let me know if you have any questions at x 55083.
Thank you
Margaret
