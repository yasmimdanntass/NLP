Back in november of last year, you have indicated that 40% of the 17. 5% (40%
Of 17. 5 is 7%) that we are allocating to egm should be billed to gary
Hickson' s group. Gary is asking for further broken down of this 40% to his
World. Can you check with vince to see what portion of the 7% should be
Charged to equity trading, rate & currency trading, agricultural trading &
Origination and convertible trading? And can I get this information back by
The end of this week because we are going to start closing on friday. If you
Have any questions, call me. Thanx.

Out of the 40% allocation to gary hickerson. Gary is responsible for
Financial trading which includes:
? Equity trading
? Rate & currency trading
? Agricultural trading & origination
? Convertible trading
Thanks for your help.

Becky,
I gave the%% for egm to shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you
Already.
I assume egm includes f/x - i/r (gary hickerson), weather, insurance (jere
Overdyke),
Oil trading and coal.
For calme I don' t have any info. Let' s split the cost evenly.

Shirley,
Grm is now with egm group. Egm wants to verify that the 17. 5% we are going
To allocate to grm is for the insurance, jere overdyke group. Egm seems to
Think that their weather, mark tawney group, is receiving support from
Research. Also, can we break out the support for calme? Calme is going to
Split into 3 bus and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for research
Supports. If you have any questions, call me. Thanx.
