HI scott,
As we discussed, I will be flying to london on monday to spend some time in
Enron' s london office. I am really looking forward to meeting you and the
Others I have corresponded with via email, phone, vc, etc.
On yesterday vince, vasant, amitava and I discussed my stay and london and
The desire to make this trip a productive one. Hence we came up with the
Following" wish list" of things I wish to accomplish while I am over there.
If you think of any other important items to add to this list, please let me
Know. After that, we can forward the list to the parties involved to find
Out if they will be available to meet with me during my stay in london.
Thanks,
Iris
