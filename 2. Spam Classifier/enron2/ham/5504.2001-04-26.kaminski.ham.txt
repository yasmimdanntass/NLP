Subject: dr. Michelle foss - energy institute
Dear mr. Kaminski,
I am writing to ask a favor for dr. Michelle foss. As you know we will
Be running our" new era" program from may 14 - may 25 th. Dr. Foss was
Wondering if on may 22 nd (between 1: 30 pm and 4: 00 pm), we would be able to
Bring
Our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will
Have
30 - 40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
Trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
Participants. At this time, we have a floor from coral energy, and are
Working with duke,
And I will be contacting mr. Paul roberts to arrange for the reliant energy
Trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
Me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
Possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!
Best regards,
Aisha jamal
