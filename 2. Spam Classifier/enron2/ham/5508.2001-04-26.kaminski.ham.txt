Margaret,
Thanks for reminding me this issue. I think i' ll be fine until I start full
Time here in the research group. As you know right now I am using curricular
Practical training as work permission. And until I graduate I am allowed do
As many as part time cpt I want to do. Because of tax purposes I think i' ll
Use this right given to me. In this case, what I need to do is that after i
And vince make sure about my full time start date (this may happen in the
Beginning of 2002), i' ll let you know and send you the necessary document you
Require to initiate my hlb visa application process. Thanks again.
Sevil,

Sevil: in order that we may proceed with your request for permanent
Residency, our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process
The hib visa, prior to the permanent residency application.
Therefore, I am attaching an hib visa questionnaire that I would like you to
Complete and return to me, together with copies of all of the documents
Listed at the bottom of the form.
Please bring these to me in 3 ac 2026 a.
