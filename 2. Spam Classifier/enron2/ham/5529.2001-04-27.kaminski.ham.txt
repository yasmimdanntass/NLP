Subject: re: enron weather research
Good afternoon mike:
I certainly am interested in determining if there may be a potential fit
There at enron. I am very enthusiastic to apply my finance and meteorology
Backgrounds in a market - based environment that is driven to achieve
Unprecedented efficiencies. Attached are two documents: 1) a
Business - focused resume, and 2) an abbreviated meteorology cv.
Graduate meteorology coursework included advanced atmospheric dynamics I and
Ii, advanced physical meteorology, boundary layer modeling, numerical
Modeling, research methods in meteorology, and turbulence.
I will look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Greg hunt
