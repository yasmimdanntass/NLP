Stinson,
He keeps bugging us about it.
Any thoughts what we should do?

HI vince -
Hope all is well with you.
Sharad hasn' t had time to evaluate our willow tree or monte carlo software
Since the middle of last year. Is there somebody else that could do it?
Please let me know who I should send the evaluation to.
Best regards,
Michael curran
