Subject: non - firm power curve building
HI vince,
Amitava and I have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for
Each region from david hoog' s double trigger folks. The objective, as they
Explain it, is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market, buy david' s
Outage product, and sell firm to the market. Accountants would like a curve
To mark the non - firm position.
My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve, but
It seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they
Have put the ball in david hoog' s court to build the curve if david wants to
Sell his product internally to the desk.
Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define" non - firm"?
The only way I can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific
Generation unit or group of units. This will allow the purchase of david' s
Outage product to cover the non - firmness risk. Tying the definition of
Non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to
Give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem
Anywhere in the region? Consequently, the non - firm curve takes on a
Unit - level interpretation, and not a region - level interpretation.
Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the" non - firm curve for the
Region"? We will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or
Group of units.
Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.
Thanks,
Vasant
