Subject: siam conference
Dear mr. Kaminski,
?
I was one of the participants of the siam conference which was held last
Week - end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the
Session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already
Gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e - mail a copy of your
Talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e - mail address.

I am a mathematics ph. D. Student at texas a & m university and I will be
Graduating this august. I am very much interested in working in the modeling
Of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and
Who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your
Research group.
?
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely
