Subject: siam conference
Dear mr. Kaminski,
I was one of the participants of the siam conference which was held last week - end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e - mail a copy of your talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e - mail address.
I am a mathematics ph. D. Student at texas a & m university and I will be graduating this august. I am very much interested in working in the modeling of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your research group.
Thank you for your time.
Sincerely
G. Aysu bilgin
