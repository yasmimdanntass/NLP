Thanks. Shirley is checking my calendar and will call you about the schedule.

Vince,
Just wanted to check with you to see if you have a preference as to when you would like to have your mid - year prc meeting. If you and your team are available, I would prefer to have it on either june 12 th, 13 th or 14 th. I am very flexible though, so please just let me know so that I can start making the necessary accommodations.
Thanks,
Anne
