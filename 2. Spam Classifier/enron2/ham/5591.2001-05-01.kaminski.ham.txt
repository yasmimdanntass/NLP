Subject: installation of new programs
Phillip,
How can I install new programs on my laptop, without
The administrator' s privileges?
One example: when I travel I use aol to get access to my mail
And to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow
Me to install it.
Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.
