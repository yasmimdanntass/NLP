Cecil,
I' ve spoken with charlene just now and she sounds very helpful.
Can you give her a call tomorrow morning to iron out exactly how
You want to access the enpower data base? I' ve left your name
With her so she' s expecting your call.
Best,
Alex

Michelle,
The name of the db administrator for enpower is charlene fricker,
5 - 3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.
I think it' s a problem many layers below gary hickerson' s level
Of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
Time.
Vince
