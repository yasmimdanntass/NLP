Subject: re: mutually agreed upon changes okay
Larry,
I had a brief discussion with our lawyers. They are strongly advising us to
Keep the changes we earlier incorporated, but to which you have not
Assented. As this is a matter of company policy, unfortunately we do not
Have much room to maneuver. If it would help you to have a direct
Conversation with the lawyers to appreciate our company' s perspective, I can
Arrange for a phone call. Please advise. Thanks.

HI rakesh,
Thanks for your work on the non - disclosure agreement.
Your integration of our mutually agreed upon modifications looks good,
Rakesh. Thanks! I' ll await your next version.
