Subject: re: london contact number
HI anita,
How are you? I arrived yesterday late morning from the london gatwick
Airport. Due to rush hour traffic, etc. It took a while to get into the city
To the hotel.
Also, due to may day (may lst) protests/riots, etc., the hotel management
Strongly recommended that we remain in the hotel.
However, I am in the office today. I can be reached via email or via
Telephone at 44 (0) 207 783 5647.
Take care,
Iris
