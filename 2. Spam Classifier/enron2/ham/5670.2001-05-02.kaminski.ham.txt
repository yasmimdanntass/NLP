Subject: re: mutually agreed upon changes okay
Larry,
I have your fax and the message. Unfortunately the corporate policy is very
Clear and standard on these matters and we cannot make exceptions. It would
Appear impossible for us to proceed with the non - disclosure agreement if it
Is not consistent with the version suggested by our legal department. Please
Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.
