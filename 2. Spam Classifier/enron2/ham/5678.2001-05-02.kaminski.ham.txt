Dear dr. Kaminski
We have talked earlier during your energy class at rice about career
Opportunities in risk management at enron. If it is possible, I would like
To meet with you and people from your group next week, preferably tuesday
(may 8). My time is flexible, I could come any time. Other days are also
Fine.
Thank you very much in advance.
Sincerely,
Konstantin kudin
