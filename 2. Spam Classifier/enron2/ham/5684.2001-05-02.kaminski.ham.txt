Subject: a friend of mine
Vince,
Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in
Becoming an enron employee. He has a phd and several years research and lab
Experience.
Richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back
To school to obtain an mba. I was wondering if you would mind looking at the
Attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard, or if you feel
I should encourage him to go back to school. I am unclear as to the
Qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.
Thank you for your help,
Kristin gandy
