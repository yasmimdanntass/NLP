Subject: working paper list & etc
??? Dear vince:
?
??? I have put together a list of finance working papers (some of which i
Brought to the interview last wednesday) which I have written since 1995
Mostly in support of my work but also (at least initially) as a learning
Tool. Several of them, however,? Do contain innovations.
???
??? I have asked ms. De claris to forward a copy to you.
?
??? As I expressed to you earlier I am particularly interested in enron
Credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will
Spawn.
?
??? I also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in
The secondary mortgage maket in the us. I do not know if enron has
Considered or is active in this market. This would be an area that I am also
Very interested and in which I think much better can be done than most of
The players in the street.
?
??? The question in my mind (hopefully not prematurely)? Is: if there is
Interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business?
?
??? I look forward to hearing from you soon.
?
??? Best regards
?
??? Joao
