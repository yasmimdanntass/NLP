Subject: working paper list & etc
Dear vince:
I have put together a list of finance working papers (some of which I brought to the interview last wednesday) which I have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also (at least initially) as a learning tool. Several of them, however, do contain innovations.
I have asked ms. De claris to forward a copy to you.
As I expressed to you earlier I am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn.
I also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us. I do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market. This would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better can be done than most of the players in the street.
The question in my mind (hopefully not prematurely) is: if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business?
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Best regards
Joao
