Christie,
Shirley reserved room 49 cl for monday 4: 00 p. M. Presentation.
Can you issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner
Details? I don' t have all the details regarding the enron field
Box and time. I am out most of the day on wednesday but we can
Discuss the details on thursday.
Hope to see you on saturday at the concert.
Vince
