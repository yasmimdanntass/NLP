Yes, that' s fine. If you can please give me her full contact details
Including e - mail and address I will have her registered as a co - speaker.
If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to
Send 200 copies directly to the venue. Although if you can get it to me on
Friday I can still insert it!
Could I please trouble you for a short biography?
Kind regards
Layla

Layla,
A few points.
I shall be glad to attend the reception.
I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
Presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (power 2000 and
Power 1999):
The copies were produced by our company copy center at no cost to you.
My associate, tanya tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
Presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It' s only fair to give her
The credit when the
Credit is due. Is it ok to include her as an additional speaker?

On these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the

Quickly as possible. I also require a short biography.
I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
