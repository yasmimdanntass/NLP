Vince,
Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist. She then asked me to contact johns hopkins sais to get resumes of possible candidates. I have completed all this. But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.
Thank you.
