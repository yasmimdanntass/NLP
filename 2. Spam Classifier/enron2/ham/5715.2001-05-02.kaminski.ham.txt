Get involved.

Vince,
Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire
An junior/full economist. She then asked me to contact johns hopkins sais to
Get resumes of possible candidates. I have completed all this. But, before
I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you
That we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or
Associate economist level.
Thank you.
