Vince,
I don' t know if you are already aware of this, but maureen raymond has been
Taken ill and I understand has received medical advice that she should not
Travel before the end of next week at the earliest.
Tara is the appropriate hr representative in london; I will ask her to keep
Both you and houston hr informed of the situation.
Many thanks, tani
