Anne,
Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to you about it
Today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.
I think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager,
Effective march 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10 k. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager.
Such promotions take place in march and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i. E. My and maureen' s procrastination).
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary hickerson is the primary client
For maureen' s services. He communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is
Unwilling to underwrite maureen' s position (he is in general unhappy with
Her contribution). This means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
Will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget.
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.
Vince

Vince,
Just wanted to touch base with you. I have tried to contact maureen so that gwen' s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but have not heard any response from her. Would you like for me to wait until I hear from maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in changing her title? I just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc.
Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your expectations during prc.
Thanks,
Anne
