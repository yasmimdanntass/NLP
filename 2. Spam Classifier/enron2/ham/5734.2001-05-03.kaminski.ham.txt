Subject: internship opportunities
Please respond to dear mr. Kaminski,
I have found the enrononline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
Working with everyone in the research department as well as those from other
Departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
Would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
This mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you
