Subject: risk desk, issue #1
Hello - - listen, wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest
Publication last week, the risk desk. Because of the size of the files we
Sent out, quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails
Over a certain size. Anyhow, if you didn' t receive the issue, hit the reply
Button and type" resend risk desk." responce so far has been great for those
Of you that received the free copy - - we think you' ll agree that it' s soon to
Become the leading" must read" publication on market, credit, price and
Operational risk management in the energy space.
Also, just a reminder, the charter price for a one year subscription ($199)
Ends soon. Let us know.
