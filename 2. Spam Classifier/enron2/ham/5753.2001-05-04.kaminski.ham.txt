Reasons for using outlook web access (owa)
1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from notes to outlook, the outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via notes, and you will not be able to start using outlook until it is configured by the outlook migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated. During this period, you can use outlook web access (owa) via your web browser (internet explorer 5. 0) to read and send mail.
Please note: your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and to - do entries imported from notes will not be available until the outlook client is configured on your desktop.
2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your outlook client is configured, you can use outlook web access (owa) for remote access to your mailbox.
Please note: at this time, the owa client is only accessible while connecting to the enron network (lan). There are future plans to make owa available from your home or when traveling abroad.
How to access outlook web access (owa)
Launch internet explorer 5. 0, and in the address window type: http:// nahou - msowaolp/exchange/john. Doe
Substitute" john. Doe" with your first and last name, then click enter. You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below. Type in" corp/your user id" for the user name and your nt password to logon to owa and click ok. You will now be able to view your mailbox.
