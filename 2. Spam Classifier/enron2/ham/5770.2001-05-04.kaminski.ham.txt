Mike,
I work for enron transportation and storage in their storage marketing group. My group has been using technical analysis from your website to help make daily storage trading revenue decisions. On your web site, you indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use. We had interviewed external technical service profiders, and chose not to buy their service because we had your information available to us to help us make financial decisions. Specifically, we need the candlestick charts and analysis on natural gas, and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural gas.
Can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis data aforementioned?
