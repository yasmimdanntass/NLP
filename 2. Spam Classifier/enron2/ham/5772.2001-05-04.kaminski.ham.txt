Mike,
I work for enron transportation and storage in their storage marketing
Group. My group has been using technical analysis from your website to help
Make daily storage trading revenue decisions. On your web site, you
Indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use. We had
Interviewed external technical service profiders, and chose not to buy their
Service because we had your information available to us to help us make
Financial decisions. Specifically, we need the candlestick charts and
Analysis on natural gas, and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural
Gas.
Can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis
Data aforementioned?
Sue neville
