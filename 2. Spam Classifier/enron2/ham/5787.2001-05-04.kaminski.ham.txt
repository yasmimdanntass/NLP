At enron box at enron field
Christie:
Could you please fill me in on the logistics? Dr. Gillis and gil whitaker
Will
Be at the apl project presentation at enron at 4 p. M.. Further, they both
Plan
To attend the dinner at enron field. However, dr. Gillis must skip the
Game due
To an early morning breakfast the next day. Will you provide special parking
At the dinner/game? I think dr. G and gil will go together, then I will have
Dr. Gillis picked up by limo, at approximately 8: 00 p. M. Does this sound
Feasible?
