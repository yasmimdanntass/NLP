Sent by e - mail? If so, please resend it to me so that I could make the
Appropriate comments. Please do this asap, since I have been waiting for
This report to give my comments for some time now.
Regards,
Sandeep.

Trust you have had the opportunity to review the draft of the dabhol report
That was sent on 24 april 2001. I assume that the circulation of the report
To the relevant people within dabhol and enron has been done at your end. It
Will be helpful if all comments are collated and send through you. The
Report can then be amended to incorporate your comments and a final version
Sent for your records. We would very much to close the assignment with the
Completion of the report.
Please do let me know, if we can do any further analysis and sensitivities
To assist enron and dabhol in the existing phase of discussions with mseb
And the state government.
Best regards
Narottam
