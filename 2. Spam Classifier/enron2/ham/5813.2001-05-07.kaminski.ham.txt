Vince,
I have left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother vikas, who is now in london, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal about the success of enron on line business which fits well in the area of his expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in london who he can speak to regarding career opportunities.
Since I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function for both the domestic and international businesses for gmac. Needless to say, this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than usual.
Talk to you later.
