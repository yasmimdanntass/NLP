Vince,
I have? Left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally.
My brother? Vikas, who is now in london, is trying to make a switch from
Consulting world to? Working for a specific firm. Over last few months, i
Have heard of great deal? About the success of enron on line business which
Fits well in the area of his? Expertise. I am wondering if you know of some
One in london who he can speak to? Regarding career opportunities.
Since? I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my
Manadate was? Broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk
Management function? For both the domestic and international businesses for
Gmac. Needless to say,? This is exciting albeit making the life a little
More hectic than? Usual.
Talk? To you later.
Anurag
