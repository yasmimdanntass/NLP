Vince,

I have left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My
Brother vikas, who is now in london, is trying to make a switch from
Consulting world to working for a specific firm. Over last few months, i
Have heard of great deal about the success of enron on line business which
Fits well in the area of his expertise. I am wondering if you know of some
One in london who he can speak to regarding career opportunities.
?
Since I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my
Manadate was broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk
Management function for both the domestic and international businesses for
Gmac. Needless to say, this is exciting albeit making the life a little more
Hectic than usual.
?
Talk to you later.

Anurag
