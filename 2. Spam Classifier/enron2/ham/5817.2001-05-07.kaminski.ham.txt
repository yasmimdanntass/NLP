Jinbaek,
May 30 sounds good. I shall inform our hr department.
I don' t see any project I could get going with your advisor on such a short
Notice.
When you come here you can determine in what area he could make
The biggest contribution to enron. I shall call or e - mail
Him independently and talk to him.

Dr. Kaminski,
I think i' ll be able to start work from the last week of may,
But not from monday,
Probably, i' ll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned.. 6/4
I am sorry.
And actually, there is an e - business conference at haas school of business,
Organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
Interested in e - business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (arie segev at haas school of business; segev@ haas. Berkeley. Edu)
Wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
During the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e - business.. (what else..?)
And has expertise in e - procurement system and marketplace...
Xml based standard such as obi, cxml, xcbl, rosettanet, biztalk..
System interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
E - catalog management, digital signature, edi, etc etc...
Many technical aspects of e - business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
That is beneficial for both enron and him.
He may travel one or two times to houston to have a meeting during the
Summer.
(and to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
Because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?
Thank you..
Sincerely,
Jinbaek
