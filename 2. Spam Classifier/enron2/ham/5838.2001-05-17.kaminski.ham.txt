Enron industrial markets
Enron industrial markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with huntco, inc. Under which over a 15 - year period enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600, 000 tons per year of hot - rolled, cold - rolled and galvanized steel products to huntco steel.

In the news
" to truly understand enron' s jeffrey skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic american cinema, wayne' s world. At 15, skilling helped launch a no - budget television station in aurora, illinois - the very thing that mike myers and dana carvey so famously spoofed on saturday night live and in two movies. The tv skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real - life skilling." - - - randall lane, worth magazine. May 2001.

" historically, newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to" very discriminating" buyers at newspaper publishers. Eim believed differently. By the end of march, eim had succeeded in closing on its 2 nd newsprint mill, making it the 7 th largest newsprint manufacturer in north america. Remarkably, in just 2 months, eim' s newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100 mm total notional value" enron commodity style" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?.. And they said it wasn' t a commodity."

News from the global flash
Enron closes major coal deal in germany
After almost six months of negotiations, enron' s coal team has signed a contract with stadtwerke bremen to supply this major german municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, enron will deliver a total of 4. 6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million (dm 440 million).
The agreement represents enron' s first significant long - term coal supply deal in germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total german coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in northern germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.
Parallel to this deal, enron also entered into a separate agreement with hms bergbau agentur, a company specialising in polish exports. Under this agreement, hms will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.
Congratulations to the whole team involved: sven becker, manfred ungethum, cornelia luptowitsch, peter bradley, jez peters and michael schuh.
