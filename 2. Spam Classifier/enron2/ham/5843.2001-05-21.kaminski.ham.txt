Subject: d - g energy software procurement
Laine,
Enclosed is a revised copy of the software licence agreement with d - g energy. The earlier version had prices and conditions of use which differed from what had been discussed over the telephone. This version brings into line the terms with what has been agreed upon, and has been given tentative approval by the president of d - g, who I met with last week.
I have highlighed the sections which have changed from the version that you sent out for signature last november.
I assume that the revised document will have to be reviewed by legal again. Let me know if I can be of any assistance in this process.
Regards,
Stinson gibner
