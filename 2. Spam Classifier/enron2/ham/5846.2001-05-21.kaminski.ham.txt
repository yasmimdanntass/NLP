Subject: meeting follow - up
Dear vince,
I enjoyed very much meeting you at the eprm conference.
As agreed, I am attaching both my resume and the paper on my dissertation work, which I will be presenting at the real options conference in ucla next month. I would be delighted to have your comments and impressions on it.
If it is of interest to you, I would also be very enthusiastic about exploring together different powerful ways of applying these concepts at enron.
Early congratulations on your son' s graduation; let me know if you come to the bay area soon.
Best regards,
