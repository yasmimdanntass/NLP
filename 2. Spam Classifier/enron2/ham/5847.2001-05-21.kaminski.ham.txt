Subject: hi,
Dr. Kaminski
How are you?
The process for starting summer work is going well,
And there will be no problem we start work
On may 30.
I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
I' m going to leave for houston on may 29
(expected time to arrival is around noon)
I am very much excited to have opportunity
To join the project making an exchange platform.
I think it' s time i' d better remind you
Of scheduling a meeting with me,
Sometime on may 30.
I hope you let me know what to to
After I arrive at houston.
And please let me know if you have anything
You think I prepare, to get better outcome
From the summer work.
If you give me a brief on the work,
It would be a great help for me to decide
Which material I should carry from here to houston.
I look forward to the date we meet,
Warm regards,
Jinbaek
