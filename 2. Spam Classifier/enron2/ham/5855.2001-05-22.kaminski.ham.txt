Subject: resignation effective june 5
Vince,
I am planning to make my resignation from enron so that june 5 th would be my last day at work. I am interested in the trading opportunity this fall and will talk again with andy about it. It will still make sense for me to resign in the mean time in order that I may start burning my non - compete period to open up my other options. In addition, it will allow me to be rehired without the burden of the noncompete should I come back in the fall.
Regards,
Stinson
