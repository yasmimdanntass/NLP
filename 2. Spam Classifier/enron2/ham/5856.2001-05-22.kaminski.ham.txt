I would like you to put me in contact with s/one at enron here in london that
Deals with weather derivatives and would be in a position to sell us options on
Weather derivatives (temperature, cat). Let me know if you are able to do that
Or if I need to work internally here in order to find out whom we have contacts
With at enron.
If you want to call me my direct line is + 44 207 336 - 2836. Alternatively I could
Call you but do bear in mind that I leave the office around 6: 30 - 7 pm london
Time. Send me an email and let me know when is a good time to talk and I will
Call you back.
Thanks in advance.
Antonella
