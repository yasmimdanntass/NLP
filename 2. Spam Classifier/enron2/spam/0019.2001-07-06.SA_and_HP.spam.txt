Every day of the week, I get questions from people all
Over the world, including my no bs gimg members,
Wanting to know some of the most valuable" secrets"
To my on - going internet success.
Let me say, above all else, I don' t believe there are any
* true *" secrets" to success on the net. What you do to
Become successful in the online world is not a" secret",
In my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear,
Repeatedly - proven strategies to succeed, whether on the
Net or off.
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice,
Consultation, or simply asking," what' s your secret?",
I have to blush & say...
Persistence and personality.
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little
Disclaimer: what makes me successful may not work the
Same for you... & your first lesson is to get over
The deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind, in
My opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
Clearly, it is not. It' s not unknown. It' s not unattainable.
It' s not years of digging to find the" secrets" to internet riches.
One thing that" gets to me" so often in my work as an
Internet consultant, author and internet success
Strategist is that so many people on the net seem to
Have this incredibly huge mental block that stands
Between themselves and success on the net. It' s
Almost as if they' ve been barraged by so many claims
Of what works and what doesn' t work, and so many
Long, complicated routes to actually succeeding in
Their online venture, that" success" is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall.
It' s not that difficult, my friends! It is not that complicated!!
Long - time friend and business associate rick beneteau
Has a new ebook out called branding you & breaking
The bank. Get it!!
Http:// www. Roibot. Com/bybb. Cgi? Im 7517 _ bybtb.
But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks
So dynamically about the true simplicity of making your
Online venture a success.
And, yes, rick & I come from the same school of
" self marketing" - marketing you! Obviously, that' s
The core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn' t
Agree with him more.
Point being, * you * are everything you do online to
Succeed. You are your web site, your business, your
Marketing piece, your customer service, your customers'
Experiences with your business - - all of it, is you!
Read his ebook & you' ll see more of what i' m saying.
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have
Standing high as you can see, blocking the path
Between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is
Not real ok? It doesn' t exist. There' s nothing there
To fear to begin with... Get over it!!
What i' m telling you is, the only thing standing between
You and the success you most desire... Is yourself.
When you realize this, you will tear down that brick
Wall by means of complete and instantaneous
Disintegration. It will no longer exist * in your mind *,
Which is the only" real" place it ever was anyhow!
Yes," persistence and personality" inherently includes
Honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other
Qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate
Goals and realize that probably the most valuable,
Powerful key to your success... Is you!
That may be the most incredible" secret" we ever
Uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall
Won' t ever get in your way again... Unless you let it.
Talk about simple!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build
Branding, and provide information....... With a 12 month goal
Of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart.
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments
Via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation
Was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in
Traditional media and by referral for more information, and
To make a professional impression on someone you may not
Meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown
Outside of anyone' s expectations....... Certainly mine and
I' ve been in this business for 25 years. The internet is not
Dead in the horse business, it is just getting it' s legs, and
The folks using it want to get all the ancillary services
On - line as well. Our site (the first we' ve developed) has
Exceeded our expectations, and we aren' t satisfied with it
Yet....... We just wanted to get it there for information!

Branding. While quality customer service and product
Have been and will always be our top priority brand building
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto. Com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on
All major search engines and directories even yahoo entering
The keyword zesto. The problem is simply that, who if anyone
Would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to
Build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout
Our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy
To remember and trademarked works in our favor because
The marketability potential is limitless.
