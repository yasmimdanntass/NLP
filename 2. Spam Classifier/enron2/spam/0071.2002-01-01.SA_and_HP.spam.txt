Portable oscilloscope:
Stingray
Portable and stylish, stingray combines the functions of oscilloscope,
Data logger, spectrum analyser, volt meter, frequency meter and signal
Generator in a single instrument. Powered from usb, stingray needs no
External power supply.
Stingray features simultaneous 12 - bit sampling on both channels, a native
Sampling rate of lms/s (20 ms/s for repetitive signals), sophisticated
Hardware triggering including delayed time base and pulse width. It also
Has a 3 rd channel which can be a waveform generator output or an external
Trigger input.

Flexible reliable force
Sensors - flexiforce.
The flexiforce
A 201 force sensor is an ultra - thin, flexible printed circuit. The force
Sensors are constructed of two layers of substrate (polyester/polyimide)
Film. On each layer, a conductive material (silver) is applied, followed
By a layer of pressure - sensitive ink. Adhesive is then used to laminate
The two layers of substrate together to form the force sensor. The active
Sensing area is defined by the silver circle on top of the
Pressure - sensitive ink. Silver extends from the sensing area to the
Connectors at the other end of the sensor, forming the conductive leads.
A 201 sensors are terminated with male square pins, allowing them to be
Easily incorporated into a circuit. The two outer pins of the connector
Are active and the center pin is inactive.
