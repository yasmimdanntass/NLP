The crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
Like you to
Proceed to
The place of the security company in order to clear
The fund and
Invest on
My behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.

That will
Enable
You take possesion of the the fund for onward
Investment for our
Mutual
Benefit. All I need from you is as follows:
1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
Will keep the
Transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
Number for

4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
