I cannot wait to see you both although we may meet at the airport on the 16/6 as that' s the day we' re going to france but I will see you both at bronagh' s house for her 30 th which we' re going to on the way back from the airport. I am so excited about seeing you!!! Liitle eva (aine) was born on tuesday
