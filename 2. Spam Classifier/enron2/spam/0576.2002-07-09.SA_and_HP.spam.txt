A
Situation that could revolutionize the health care industry
Strong health care sector growth
Most investors desire to be in a stock from the beginning
Of its growth, ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ is one of those opportunities.
Revenues to increase over 500%
To over $18 million from $3 million with its
Pending acquisition of 47 physical therapy outpatient centers and
Institutional pharmacy businesses, currently owned by cybercare,
Inc. ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ also just announced a national alliance
With patient - pay. Com
That will enable ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ to market its services on a
National scale. We believe the potential is enormous for this expanding
Dynamic health care information technology company.
Health care sector rerepresents 15% of the total us
Gross domestic product while inflation
In the us has been around 2% per year, the us health care ÃÂ s
Inflationary rate rose over 11% per year. Health care costs are
Spiraling out of control. ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ provides technology
Based products and services in full compliance with newly mandated
Government requirements (hipaa), that help medical professionals
Save time and money, by utilizing ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ s state of the
Art systems.
Understanding hipaa
The health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996
(public law 104 - 191),
Also known as hipaa, was enacted as part of a broad congressional
Attempt at incremental healthcare reform. Part of the law requires
The us dept. Of health and human services (dhhs) to develop standards
And requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information
That identifies individual patients. The requirements outlined by
The law are far - reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain
Or transmit electronic health information must comply. ÃÂ ibxg ÃÂ
Offers all health care providers with a viable, already in place
Solution to ÃÂ hipaa ÃÂ compliance.
Ibxg specializes in health data management
It is a huge market comprised of over one million health care professionals.
This company has emerged, with solutions to many problems facing
The health care industry, by providing health care professionals
The ability to deliver outstanding patient care with optimum efficiency.
In past years, venture capitalists have invested more than $20 billion
In information technology companies, confirming a very large financial
Interest in the health care sector.
Will ibxg revolutionize the health care industry?
They could. Virtually every aspect of the way health care is delivered
Is impacted in a positive fashion, by ibxg' s technology. Ibxg has
Developed and deployed innovative, cost - effective methods for integrating
Financial, administrative and information services for the health
Care industry. Utilizing in - house development capabilities combined
