MultI - level marketing is a huge mistake for most people
Mlm has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The
Pursuit of the" mlm dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
Friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that mlm is
Fatally flawed, meaning that it cannot work for most people.
The companies and the few who earn the big money in mlm are not going to
Tell you the real story. Finally, there is someone who has the courage to
Cut through the hype and lies and tell the truth about mlm.
