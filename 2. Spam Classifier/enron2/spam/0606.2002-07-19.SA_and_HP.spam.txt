Your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
With information that includes: how to send bulk
E - mailslegally, where to find thousand of free classified ads and much,
Much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture
Going: method #1: sending bulk e - mail
Legally
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - let' s say that you
Decide to start small, just to see howit goes, and we' ll assume you and
Those involved send outonly 5, 000 emails each. Let' s also assume that
The mailingreceives only a 0. 2% response (the response could be
Muchbetter but lets just say it is only 0. 2%. Also, many
Peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead ofonly
5, 000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5, 000
E - mails. With a 0. 2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1. Those
10 people resonded by sending out 5, 000 e - mails eachfor a total of
50, 000. Out of those 50, 000 e - mails only 0. 2% responded with
Orders. That' s 100 people responded andordered report #2. Those
100 people mail out 5, 000 e - mailseach for a total of 500, 000 e - mails.
The 0. 2% response to that is 1000 orders for report #3. Thoe 1000
People send out 5, 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent
Out. The 0. 2% response to that isl 0, 000 orders for report #4.
Those 10, 000 people send out 5, 000 e - mails each for a total of 50, 000, 000 (50
Million) e - mails. The 0. 2% response to that is 100, 000 orders
Forreport #5. That' s 100, 000 orders times $5 each = 500, 000 (a
Half a million). Your total income in this
Example is: 1...... $50 +
2...... $500 + 3...... $5, 000
+ 4...... $50, 000 +
5...... $500, 000.................. Grand total =
$555, 550. 00 numbers do not lie. Get a
Pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible
Responses and no matter how you calculate it, you
Will still make a lot of
Money! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
Ordering out of 5, 000 people you mailed. Dare to think for a moment what
Would happen if everyone, or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100, 000
E - mailseach or more? There are over 250 million people on the
Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many peoplewill do
Just that, and more! Method #2: placing
Free ads on the internet
On the net is very, very inexpensive and thereare hundreds of free places to
Advertise. Placing a lot offree ads on the internet will easily get a
Larger response. We strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add
Method #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do
Is e - mail them the report they ordered. That' s it! Always
Provide same dayservice on all orders. This will guarantee that the
E - mailsthey send out, with your name and address on it, will beprompt
Because they can not advertise until they receive
Thereport. Order each report by it number
& name only. Note: always send $5 cash (us currency) for each
Report. Checks are not accepted. Make sure the cash is wrapped inat
Lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope. On one of those
Sheets of paper, write the number and the nameof the report you are

Live in chicago. I am an accountant with a major us corporation and i
Makepretty good money. When I received this program I grumbledto
Jody about receiving" junk mail". I made fun of thewhole thing,
Spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved. I
" knew" it wouldn' t work. Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence
And a few days latershe jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun
Of her, and was ready to lay the old" I told you so" on her whenthe thing
Didn' t work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
Received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received a total
Of $147, 200. 00 all cash! I was shocked. I have joined jody in her
" hobby". Mitchell wof, chicago,
Being the gambling type, it took me several weeks tomake up my mind to
Participate in this plan. But conservativethat I am, I decided that
The initial investment was so littlethat there was just no way that i
Wouldn' t get enough ordersto at least get my money back. I was
Surprised when I foundmy medium sized post office box crammed with
Orders. I made $319, 210. 00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing
About thisdeal is that it does not matter where people live.
Theresimply isn' t a better investment with a faster return andso
