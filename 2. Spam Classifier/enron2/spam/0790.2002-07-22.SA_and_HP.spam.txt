For your kind attention,
Request for assistance
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me. However, I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.
I am barrister adewale coker, a family lawyer to our former military rule, general sanI abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him. The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of abacha' s enemies. Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside kano state their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention. Although, a lot of money have been recovered from mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there' s still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of us $50 million. This money us $50 million is already in north american and if you are interested, we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds, and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the security company.
Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as abacha' s confidant. Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project. I await your urgent response. Thanks.
Yours faithfully
Barrister adewale coker.
