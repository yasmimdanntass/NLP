I absconded with sum of twenty five million united states dollars (us $25, 000, 000) which was part of the money meant for campaigning for president robert mugabe' s re - election into office under zaunpe party. Presently I have been able to move the funds diplomatically to a security company in the netherlands.
My request: I am looking for a trustworthy individual or firm to advice me in the right investment as well as to provide account where the funds will be lodge into. Moreso, I am interested in buying propertys for residence as my family will be residing there in the near future.
