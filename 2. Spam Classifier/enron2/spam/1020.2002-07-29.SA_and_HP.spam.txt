News july 16, 2002 I 2 corp enters into research and development agreement with nevada gaming equipment supplier for live remote bingo.
The general feeling of the top internet lawyers and analysts is that" online gambling and sports betting is here to stay. ÃÂ attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that governments are ill equipped to enforce.
What ÃÂ s more, there are no competitors for the company ÃÂ s method or technology for remote wagering. I 2 corp is the only company in the world that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. I 2 corp is currently negotiating with
Major casinos globally.
Michael pollock of the pollock gaming resource group (prrg) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. ÃÂ the study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on - site patrons. ÃÂ a copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http:// www. Gamingobserver. Com /.
I 2 corp is the holding company for home gambling network, inc. Hgn holds u. S. Patent 5, 800, 268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other las vegas casino games.
Fact: currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real - time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. I 2 corp recently won judgment against giant uunet a subsidiary of mci/worldcom in a u. S. Federal court for patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why I 2 corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude I 2 corp ÃÂ s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued!
Recommendation: strong buy
