ÃÂ I ÃÂ m a man of my 40 ÃÂ s and I really know my stuff. I don ÃÂ t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path. I used to have to take valium in the past. Not anymore with the temple ÃÂ 3 ÃÂ. It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70 ÃÂ s. I am very satisfied with all of your products. I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure. Whoever makes this stuff is an artist at it. Who would have thought?! ÃÂ
