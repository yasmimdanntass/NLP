Parents of 15 - year old - find $71, 000 cash hidden in
His closet!
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
Just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (usa).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
She came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
Beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old
Sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
She opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five - dollar bills, twenties,
Fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles.
" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41 - year - old
Woman," there was over $71, 000 dollars in that bag - - that' s more than my
Husband earns in a year".
The woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where
He worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away
And they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did
They suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
Actually finding it in the closet.
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via e - mail, a type of
" report" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet. Everyday
After school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
Computer in his bedroom.
" I just got the e - mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
On it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever
15 - year - old.
The e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
And move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to
The top of the list.
The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
Dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
Name at the top of the 5 - address list." I get junk e - mail all the time, and
Really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.
Within the first few days of sending out the e - mail, the post office box
That his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions
Began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.
" about a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
Had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
Yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought i
Was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on," I went up to the
Counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
Home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all". Over
The next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the e - mail." the
Money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
Closet, barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike
To several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties,
Fifties and hundreds.
" I didn' t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
With like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
Lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
Money] and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a
Really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
And my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
Bank down the street (laughs)." surprisingly, the boy did not have any
Reason to be afraid. The reporting news
Team examined and investigated the so - called" chain - letter" the boy was
Sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all. In fact, it was
Completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws, title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also in
The code of federal regulations, volume 16, sections 255 and 436, which
State a product or service must be exchanged for money received.
Every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
" please send me report number xyx". This simple note made the letter
Legal because he was exchanging a service (a report on how - to) for a
Five - dollar fee.
[this is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
The system works and get your $71, 000 - please continue reading. What
Appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
You can use it too - just follow the simple instructions].
Be financially free like others within a year!!! Before you
Say" bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
Hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
Show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
Can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
Program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
People can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
Megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".
Due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this
Program has attained, it is currently working better
Than ever.
Note * follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.
In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
That the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
Following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
For reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.
This is what one had to say:" thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was
Approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad i
Finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
Effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610, 470. 00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".
Pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.
Here is another testimonial:" this program has been around for a long time
But I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
Mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
And walaa..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month i
Only made $240. 00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290, 000. 00. So far, in the past 8 months by re - entering the program, i
Have made over $710, 000. 00 and I am playing it again. The key to
Success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change
Anything." more testimonials later but first,

Your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
With invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk
E - mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much
More. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:
Method #1: by sending bulk e - mail legally
Let' s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will
Assume you and those involved send out only 5, 000 e - mails each. Let' s
Also assume that the mailing receive only a 0. 2% response (the response
Could be much better but lets just say it is only 0. 2%. Also many people
Will send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5, 000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5, 000 e - mails.
With a 0. 2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1. Those 10
People responded by sending out 5, 000 e - mail each for a total of 50, 000.
Out of those 50, 000 e - mails only 0. 2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered report #2.
Those 100 people mail out 5, 000 e - mails each for a total of 500, 000 e - mails.
The 0. 2% response to that is 1000 orders for report #3.
Those 1000 people send out 5, 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million
E - mails sent out. The 0. 2% response to that is 10, 000 orders for report #4.
Those 10, 000 people send out 5, 000 e - mails each for a total of
50, 000, 000 (50 million) e - mails. The 0. 2% response to that is 100, 000
Orders for report #5. That' s 100, 000 orders times
$5 each = $500, 000. 00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5, 000 + 4..... $50, 000 + 5..... $500, 000.......
Grand total = $555, 550. 00
Numbers do not lie. Get a pencil & paper and figure out
The worst possible responses and no matter how you
Calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
Remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people
Ordering out of 5, 000 you mailed to. Dare to think for a moment
What would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people
Mailed 100, 000 e - mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on
The internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
That, and more!
Method #2: by placing free ads on the internet
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
Free places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
Easily get a larger response.
We strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add method #2 as
You go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e - mail them the
Report they ordered. That' s it. Always provide same day service on all
Orders. This will guarantee that the e - mail they send out with your name
And address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
Receive the report.
= order each report by its number & name only. Notes: always
Send $5 cash (u. S. Currency) for each report. Checks not
Accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
Sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, write
The number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e - mail
Address and your name and postal address.

" my name is mitchell. My wife, jody and I live in chicago. I am an
Accountant with a major u. S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to jody about receiving
" junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
Population and percentages involved. I" knew" it wouldn' t work. Jody
Totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
With both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
" I told you so" on her when the thing didn' t work. Well, the laugh was on
Me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
Days she had received total $147, 200. 00.... All cash! I was shocked.
I have joined jody in her" hobby".

" not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
Mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
The initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i
Wouldn' t get enough orders to at least get my money back"." I was
Surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
Orders. I made $319, 210. 00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
This deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn' t a
Better investment with a faster return and so big".

" I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if i
Should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
Another copy, so I had to wait until I was e - mailed again by someone
Else...... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
This one! I made more than $490, 000 on my first try and all the money
Came within 22 weeks".
