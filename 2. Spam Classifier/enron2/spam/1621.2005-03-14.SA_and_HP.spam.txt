Price -. 026
The vaiue of eogi' s shares wI | | skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
Market in a generation.
2. Natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years.
3. With multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
Reserves worth muitI - miilions, eogI is selling for less than 1/4 the
Vaiue of its assets.
4. Emerson oI | and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn
Unproductive oI | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises. Already
Shares in the oI | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market.
In fact, four of dow jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the
Past year are energy reiated. But it' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
Deveiopers like emerson (eogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In
The last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadrupie
Returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
EogI shares, because it won' t be a bargain for | ong. This smail company
With a comparably smail market vaiue, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
And gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
The daily jump in energy prices.
But all that wI | | change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
Into production, bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
Capture the attention of the market, and have an equaliy explosive effect on
The share price.
What wI | | the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
OI | and gas' shares? Wel | we do know this - the great thing about
Investing in eogI is that your gains don' t depend on further increases in
The price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or deciine
Siightly, you will stiil make a very heaithy return. Of course, energy
Prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
Or so as predicted, meaning the vaiue of eogi' s assets and earnings
Wiil soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors wiil be
Staggering.
Overall, we consider eogI to be one of the last outstanding energy
Plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been reaiized,
EogI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
Identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. Eogi' s oil and
Gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
Production. Early investors wI | | secure optimum gains, and any additiona | news in
This area wI | | realiy turn up the heat, causing us to revise our
Targets upward in next week' s builetin.
