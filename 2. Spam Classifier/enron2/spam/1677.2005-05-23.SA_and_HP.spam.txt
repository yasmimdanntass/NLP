1. Price charts confirm oI | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
Market in a generation.
2. Natural gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years.

Value of its assets.
4. Emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
Unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. Already
Shares in the oI | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market.
In fact, four of dow jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the
Past year are energy reiated. But it' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
Developers like emerson (eogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In
The last 12 months, many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
Returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervaiued
EogI shares, because it won' t be a bargain for | ong. This sma | | company
With a comparably smail market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oil
And gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
The daily jump in energy prices.
But all that wiil change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
Into production, bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
Capture the attention of the market, and have an equaliy explosive effect on
The share price.
What wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
Oil and gas' shares? We | | we do know this - the great thing about
Investing in eogI is that your gains don' t depend on further increases in
The price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
Siightiy, you wI | | stil | make a very heaithy return. Of course, energy
Prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
Or so as predicted, meaning the vaiue of eogi' s assets and earnings
WI | | soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be
Staggering.
Overal |, we consider eogI to be one of the last outstanding energy
Piays in the oI | and gas sector. Once this discovery has been reaiized,
EogI shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention. We have
Identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation. Eogi' s oil and
Gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
Production. Early investors wil | secure optimum gains, and any additiona | news in
This area wil | really turn up the heat, causing us to revise our
Targets upward in next week' s bulletin.
