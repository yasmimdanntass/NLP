Investors are making huge gains as the world bets online.
Could gaming transactions inc. (gtts) be the next stock to rock?
Recently,
We read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and
How it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment. Over the
Next few days, as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could
Have, we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all
Over the media - in newspapers, online and on television. It became
Obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to
Bet on games. We also came across some staggering statistics.
Merrill lynch, for example, has predicted that gambling has the
Potential to account for a full 1% of global economic activity! Another
Source, ecommercetimes. Com, recently reported that the scope of this
Business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the
Single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce. The online
Gaming industry, in other words, appears to be booming, and it may be
An ideal time to is time to invest.
We decided to
Find out who the key players were in the business. After speaking with
A number of industry insiders, the trail led us to an emerging,
Publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc. (ggts). After a
Close look at ggts, we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months.
Although
Ggts is a new company, it has some surprisingly experienced players at
The helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old.
The company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno.
And its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the
Keno. Com website, which, if youre marketing keno, is as good as it
Gets. Keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream
Gambling game. Ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online
Gambling games, including poker and sports - book betting. Once it offers
These popular games, and given that it already has keno. Com online, the
Company could bring in great revenues, attracting a lot of attention in
The investment community and driving up its stock price.
After a successful north american launch,
Gaming transactions inc. (gtts) has translated its games into chinese
And is about to hit asia. This initiative looks like a wise business
Decision: many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest
Source of online gambling revenue by 2007, so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach.
What
Does all this tell us? A brand new company, a popular, well - known game,
One of the biggest spreads for the house, a growing market, experienced
Management, and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors. If youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc., click here to read a free ten - page report...
