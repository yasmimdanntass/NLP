The vaiue of eogi' s shares will skyrocket:
1. Price charts confirm oI | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |
Market in a generation.
2. Natura | gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years.

Reserves worth multI - mI | | ions, eogI is selling for | ess than 1/4 the
Vaiue of its assets.
4. Emerson oI | and gas speciaiizes in using new technoiogy to turn
Unproductive oI | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises. Aiready
Shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market.
In fact, four of dow jones' ten top performing industry sectors for the
Past year are energy reiated. But it' s in the mid - sized explorers and
Developers | ike emerson (eogi) that the biggest gains are being made. In
The | ast 12 months, many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
Returns.
Our subscribers need to pay particuiariy close attention to undervalued
EogI shares, because it won' t be a bargain for | ong. This smail company
With a comparably small market value, is sitting on a bonanza of oI |
And gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
The daiiy jump in energy prices.
But al | that wI | | change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move
Into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
Capture the attention of the market, and have an equa | | y expiosive effect on
The share price.
What wI | | the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
Oil and gas' shares? Well we do know this - the great thing about
Investing in eogI is that your gains don' t depend on further increases in
The price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline
Slightiy, you will stI | | make a very heaithy return. Of course, energy
Prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
Or so as predicted, meaning the value of eogi' s assets and earnings
Will soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be
Staggering.
Overall, we consider eogI to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
Plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been reaiized,
EogI shares wI | | surge sharply on heavy investor attention. We have
Identified this discovery for immediate accumulation. Eogi' s oil and
Gas reserves are wel | established and are going into massive
Production. Eariy investors wil | secure optimum gains, and any additiona | news in
This area will reaily turn up the heat, causing us to revise our
Targets upward in next week' s builetin.
