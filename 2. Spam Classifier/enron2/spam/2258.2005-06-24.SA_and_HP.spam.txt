Subject: investment/partnership proposal
Dear sir,
I am mr. FemI olugbade, a bank executive. I am sending this
Message to you in confidence. I am asking for your favor in
The transfer of some money belonging to one mr barry kelly
(deceased) whose death we were not aware of until we no longer
Got reply to our routine notifications to his forwarding
Address. We were however told by his employers, that he died
From an automobile crash. Now all attempts to trace his next
Of kin has proved abortive. There is however no trace in any
Of his official documents of a next of kin.
The basic line here is that at the expiration of 6 years, the
Money will revert to the ownership of the
Government. Nobody is ever coming to claim this money having
Spent 5 and a half years in our bank.
So all I am asking from you is that you should stand in as his
Next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt
Government officials. Also note that, it is impossible for the
Money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin,
Who also must be a foreigner.
Further workings of this initiative, and a sharing ratio, plus
Possible areas of investment will be
Discussed as soon as I hear from you.
Best regards.
FemI olugbade
