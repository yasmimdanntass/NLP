Foreign ip address and we have reason to belive that your account was used
By a third party without your authorization.

May have been initiated by you.
Therefore, if you are the rightful account holder, click on the link below to log into your account and follow the instructions. Https:// www. Paypal. Com/cgI - bin/webscr? Cmd = _ login - run
If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporarily suspend
Your account.
If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account
Holder, please be aware that it is in violation of paypal policy to represent
Oneself as another paypal user. Such action may also be in violation of
Local, national, and/or international law. Paypal is committed to assist
Law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate
Personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft.
