Subject: validation your ebay account could be suspended
Your credit/debit card information must be updated
Dear ebay member,
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your ebay account from a
Foreign ip address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by
A third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account
While traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you
The login attempt was made from:
Ip address: 172. 25. 210. 66
Isp host: cache - 66. Proxy. Aol. Com
By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our
Users provide us when they register on the site. However, because user
Verification on the internet is difficult, ebay cannot and does not confirm each
User' s purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification
System o help you evaluate with who you are dealing with.
Click on the link below, fill the form and then submit as we will verify
Please save this fraud alert id for your reference
Please note - if
You choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally
Suspend your account.
* please do not respond to this e - mail as your reply will not be received.
Respectfully,
Trust and safety department
Ebay inc.
