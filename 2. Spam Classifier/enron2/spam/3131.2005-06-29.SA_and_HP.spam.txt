Subject: charity sees the need not the cost...
Dear friend,
As you read this, I don' t want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is mr. Reza abdulla, a merchant in safat, in (kuwait) I was married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that god has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u. A. E, algeria and malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars (u. S. $10. 700, 000) that I have with a finance/security company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside only 20% for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: reza _ abdulla@ walla. Com
God be with you.
Regards,
Mr. Reza abdulla
