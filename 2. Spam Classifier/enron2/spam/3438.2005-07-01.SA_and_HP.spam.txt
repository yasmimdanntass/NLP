Subject: greetings from u. A. E
Hello my dear,
Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am director of procurement department at the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources, here in the united arab emirates. I obtained your email while searching for a reliable person, who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds. This fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the petroleum ministry. This fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned ministry. The contracts had been executed and commissioned. What I am about to receive now, is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom I helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest. This is a normal deal that goes in my ministry by top officials.
On our part, all modalities have been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days. All I want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf, because as government official I cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor, neither I am allowed by law to operate/run foreign bank accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.
Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer. I wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account. As soon as you indicate your interest, further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once I hear from you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.
Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.
Best regards,
Engr. Kaballa abdalla.
Ministry of petroleum and ministry resources.
