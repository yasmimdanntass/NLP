Several factors affect your mortgage rate:
The amount of your loan can increase your interest rate if the amount financed exceeds the conforming loan
Limits established. The conforming loan limit changes at the beginning of each year.
Shorter loans, such as 20 year or 15 year note, can save you thousand of dollars in interest payments over
The life of the loan, but your monthly payments will be higher. An adjustable rate mortgage may get you started
With a lower interest rate than a fixed rate mortgage, but your payments could get higher when the interest rate changes.
A larger down payment ÃÂ greater than 20% - will give you the best possible rate. Down payments of 5% or less should expect to pay a higher rate as you are starting with less equity as collateral. If you' ve got the cash now and want to lower your payments, you can pay on your loan to lower your mortgage rate. It' s a simple concept, really: in exchange for more money upfront, lenders are willing to lower the interest rate they charge, cutting the borrower' s payments. Closing costs are fees paid by the lender, if you don ÃÂ t want to pay all of the closing costs, expect a higher rate which will pay the lender additional interest over the life of the loan.
Credit quality and debt - to - income - ratio affect the terms of your loan through fico score. If you have good credit and your monthly income far surpasses your monthly debt obligations, you will get approved at a lower interest rate. However, if your monthly income barely covers your minimum debt obligations, even if you have a credit report, you will not receive the lowest available interest rate.

Get your hands on some cash:
Another way to make a refinance work for you is to refinance for more than the balance remaining on your old mortgage - - in effect, tapping your home equity, or" cashing out," in mortgage speak. Thanks to favorable rates, you may be able to do so without boosting your monthly outlay. For example, at 8. 5%, the payment on a $200, 000, 30 - year fixed rate mortgage is $1, 538. But at 7. 5%, that same payment lets you borrow nearly $20, 000 more.
The best use for the extra cash is to pay off any higher rate loans you may have. Let' s say that you are carrying a $15, 000 car loan at 10% and making minimum payments on a $10, 000 credit card balance at 17%. Your monthly payments on those debts would total $680. Then assume you refinanced your mortgage, taking out an additional $25, 000 to pay off your car and credit card loans. Result: at 7. 5%, your additional monthly mortgage payment would total only $175, so you would come out $505 ahead ($680 - $175 = $505).
Of course, all the extra cash needn' t go for paying off debts. When the menards swapped their arm for a fixed rate last december, they also increased their mortgage load by $34, 000, from $106, 000 to $140, 000. They used $3, 000 of the proceeds to pay their refinancing costs and another $17, 000 to pay off a 10% home equity loan, which had been costing them $250 a month. Then they spent the remaining $14, 000 to build a garage for roger' s antique car collection - - and they did all this for just another $19 a month
