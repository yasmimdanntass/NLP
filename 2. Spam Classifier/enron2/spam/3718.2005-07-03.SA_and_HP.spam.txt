Subject: assistance me
My name is mr. Newton gwarada, the stepson of mr. Terry ford of zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address; I got it from the net. Dont be worried because I am contacting you in good faith.
During the current crisis against the farmer of zimbabwe by the supporters of our president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers.
My stepfather was one of the best farmer in the country and knowing that he did not support the president political ideology, the president supporters invaded my stepfather" s farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments.
After the death of my stepfather, my mother and I with my younger sister decided to move out of zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. We took along with us the money my stepfather kept in the safe in my mother' s house which amounted to the sum of us $20 m (twenty million united states dollars) to the republic of south africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company for safe - keeping.
Because of our present status (political refugees), my mother and I are sriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of south africa.
If my proposition is considered, for assisting us to transfer this money to your country, we will offer you 20% of the total fund, and 5% of the total will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction, 75% will be for my family to invest. In your country under your supervision.
For detailed information, you can contact me direct.
I would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence. Your immediate response will be highly wecomed.
Best regards,
Mr. Newton gwarada
