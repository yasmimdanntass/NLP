Subject: expert web site analysis - at no charge
Do you think that your web site should be producing more sales than it currently does? Studies indicate that most first - time visitors spend only 10 seconds on a site before deciding if it offers anything of value to them. Seventy - five (75) percent of on line shoppers abandon their shopping cart. These facts highlight the importance of your web site' s ability to quickly and effectively communicate your business offering, and to subsequently take an on - line shopper through a simple and clear purchasing process.
