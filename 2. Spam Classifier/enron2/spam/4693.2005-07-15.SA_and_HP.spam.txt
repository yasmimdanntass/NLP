Prior to the 1 st case of mad cow, u. S. Beef exports in 2003 in the us were valued at near $6 billion. Most of the export dollars have since been lost with the international us beef ban imposed in 2004.
Over 90 million cattle are in feedlots in the u. S.
Over 35 million cattle have been slaughtered in the u. S. Annually
Beckman coulter, inc. Is a leading manufacturer of biomedical testing instrument

In most countries around the globe, the discovery of a cow with mad cow disease' leads to the immediate slaughter of hundreds, even thousands of cattle out of wide spread fear of disease spread and the need to complete disease testing on the dead animals. Costly international beef recalls' are common since mad cow' testing (until now) has only been conducted after the slaughter process. Genethera' s live animal' blood test could lead to halting of mass slaughters and widespread panic, while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
Through the testing of a single blood sample, genethera could end the need to slaughter entire herds of cattle and other animals for disease testing - saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
Currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california, genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to meet this exploding bse testing demand.

Genethera (gtha): making their mark in biotech
Genethera has just recently teamed up with biotech giant beckman coulter inc.
They are the first to market with a blood test for mad cow disease on live cattle
They have the ability to detect numerous infectious diseases utilizing genetic methods from the blood of a live animal
They are the first to market with a blood test for detecting cwd
They are presently developing a therapeutic vaccine for cwd and mad cow disease using rna interference technology
They are currently developing a blood test using the same platform for breast and prostate cancer detection with their strategic partner xpng (xpention genetics inc.)
Genethera could end beef recalls' and potentially the slaughter of millions of animals around the globe while saving the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year
Currently funded by an institutional money manager in southern california, genethera has plans to open laboratories worldwide to handle this growing bse testing demand.
Genethera could generate revenues over $13 million for every 1% of cattle tested in the usa alone
International testing figures would be staggering.
Genethera technology:
Genethera' s business is based on its integrated technology platform (itp) that combines a proprietary diagnostic solution called gene expression assay (gea (tm)) with purivax (tm), its system for analyzing large - scale dna sequencing.
The first part of this platform is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays solutions using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction (f - pcr) technology to detect the presence of infectious disease from the blood of live animals. The second part of the itp is the development of therapeutic vaccines using rna interference technology. It also allows for the efficient, effective, and continuous testing, management and treatment of animal populations. These facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds. Our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals, but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines.
Genethera inc. Is committed to providing global access to cutting edge biotechnology services to fellow scientists in academia, the pharmaceutical industry, and the biotechnology industry. Primarily, genethera' s expertise focuses on technology relevant to animal and human immunotherapy. Genethera is dedicated to furnishing dependable, high quality, cost - effective and prompt client consulting services. These services are backed by the cumulative experiences of greater than 100 years of research and development in both government and industry by genethera' s senior scientists. Genethera develops a commercial - scale implementation of adenovector purification process to support rd material production. Furthermore, genethera evaluates and tests commercially available expression vectors and incorporates them into its vector repertoire. These technologies are well established within the repertoire of genethera' s scientific staff.
Genethera can uniquely detect and treat a variety of diseases in animals while they are still alive.
The company provides genetics - based diagnostic and vaccine solutions to meet the growing demands of today' s veterinary industry and tomorrow' s agriculture and healthcare industries. The company is organized and operated both to continually apply its scientific research to more effective management of diseases and, in so doing, realize the commercial potential of molecular biotechnology.
The core of genethera' s operation is the ongoing development of molecular diagnostic assays using real time fluorogenic polymerase chain reaction. (f - pcr) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases. It also allows for the efficient, effective, and continuous testing, management and treatment of animal populations. These facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds. Our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals, but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines.
To date, genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease, a disease affecting elk and deer in north america. Diagnostic assays for e. ColI ol 57: h 7 and johnne' s disease are in the final stages of development. Vaccines for e. ColI ol 57: h 7 and johnne' s disease, both of which are diseases affecting cattle, are in advanced stages of development. In the future, the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases/animals, the immediate targets being mad cow, hoof mouth, west nile and newcastle.
Genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e. D. R. F. Gene sequence. The e. D. R. F. Gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human. The patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow (bse) in cattle, cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans
The company' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost. The test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr, dna analyzing robotics equipment. Genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician. The project will prove highly profitable at approx $4. 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way.
A multI - billion dollar, international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe.
Japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone. They used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad' s rapid test. Costs are between $20 and $40 dollars per test. Most importantly, other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed. Testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly.
Japan spent between $60 million - $120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004.
Genethera' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system. The sample is then mailed to the lab for testing. The company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test.
