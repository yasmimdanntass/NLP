Attention sir
In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source, first of all, I wish to introduce myself to you, I am mr usman bello. The only surviving son of the late dr. Mustapha bello who was one of the aid to the former leader of my country iraq before he was killed in a war in my country. I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise but honestly I do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $10, 000, 000. 00 in your company which I inherited from my father proceeds before his death. My mother is from haitI while my father is from iraq before they got married as husband and wife. I am now left with my only surviving mother who unfortunately has been critically ill since late last year because of the shock the death of my late father caused her.
When my father with the rest members of my family was killed on 16 th january 2003 during the war, I and my mother escaped to iran with the help of united nations officials from there we came to thailand through the united nation peace keeping pilot. The fund is now with the financial firm. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trust worthy and kind enough to assist me, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total fund and 10% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction.
Whatever your decision is, please contact me immediately through the above email. I also appeal to you to keep this matter secret for the interest of my family.
Best regards.
Usman bello.
