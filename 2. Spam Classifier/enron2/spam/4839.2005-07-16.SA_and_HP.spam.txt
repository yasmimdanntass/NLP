Security measures - are you traveling?
Paypal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community
Of buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, paypal
Employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our
AntI - fraud teams regularly screen the paypal system for unusual
Activity.
We recently noted one or more attempts to log in to your account from a
Foreign country. If you accessed your account while traveling, the
Attempt (s) may have been initiated by you.
Because the behavior was unusual for your account, we would like to take
An extra step to ensure your security and you will now be taken through
A series of identity verification pages.
